mission: |
  Susan’s Place is dedicated to serving medically frail and mentally ill homeless women, providing them with healthy meals, clean clothing, recreational activities and a broad range of primary health care and social services. Susan’s Place gives these women a safe and supportive environment and the services that will help keep them re-housed after we place them in permanent housing.
