  In 1996, Making Books Sing began as the family theatre and education program of the Tony Award-winning Vineyard Theatre. After five years of steady growth, the Vineyard Theatre’s Founder, Barbara Zinn Krieger, left her post there as Executive Director to establish Making Books Sing as an independent, 501© 3 organization.  Today, she and co-founder, Debra Sue Lorenzen, continue to guide Making Books Sing’s mission:

  

  To empower children to experience the performing arts and literature as captivating, accessible vehicles for their imaginations, artistic expression and learning. 

  Our unique combination of professional musical theatre, high-quality books and hands-on theater education aim to nurture children’s love for theatre and books, and help children grow into literate, creative and socially aware individuals.

  We  partner each year with up to 25 NYC public elementary schools, four homeless shelters for families, and cultural organizations around the city. Our educational programs reach more than 5,000 children and families each year, while our theatre audiences exceed 12,000 in a four-borough tour across New York.

    S.A.F.E. Weekly Workshops

    Making Books Sing wanted to help homelessness children and their families.  In 2007, we gave voice to this group by creating a full-scale musical about a homeless mother and child.  12,000 children attended the show and more than 100 homeless children and their families attended as our guests.  It was one of our best shows ever!.  In 2008, Making Books Sing piloted a far more extensive program, entitled S.A.F.E (which stands for Shelters, Art, Families and Education). The idea was that a series of art workshops at each shelter would create a safe, nurturing environment that fosters self-expression, literacy development, team building and hope.  A grant of $1000 will help us have 4 workshops- in each shelter. By developing books into plays and musicals, and creating props and visual arts to support the play, students experience the fun and stress relief inherent in making art, while reinforcing reading/writing skills and other important skills (artistic thinking, problem solving, relating to an audience, team building and supporting your peers, etc).  Additionally, field trips to cultural institutions throughout New York City help these students to explore and enjoy New York City.

    Volunteer 

    Students may help Making Books Sing staff prepare for our public performances by creating gift bags for our ticket buyers at each performance. Each season we prepare 500 gift bags with fun-filled family items including magazines, coupons, toys, posters and other cool items. We request one (1) class to volunteer two hours of their time to prepare the gift bags. The volunteer opportunity will take place in early-mid January before our performances begin.

    

    We will provide the volunteering class lunch and complimentary tickets for them and their parents to see one of the public performances.

    

    We do not charge for these gift bags - they are free to families who have purchased tickets to our amazing musical!
