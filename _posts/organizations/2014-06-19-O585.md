mission: |
  Hope has a two-pronged approach to fighting poverty.  HOPE serves New Yorkers whose lives have been shattered by poverty. We provide job readiness instruction, work internships, computer training, GED classes, breakfast, lunch, clothing, and emergency grants. Combining the very best elements of emergency assistance and employment programs, we work with each client for a minimum of two years, with a lifetime of follow-up services.  While our training model has been recognized as among the nationâ€™s most effective, its impact on poverty is on a local level. Therefore, in addition to our direct services, we operate a research and education initiative. Through these efforts, we help the general public, the media, and policy makers understand that there is no quick fix to end poverty.
