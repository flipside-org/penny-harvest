  Eight week old, adorable puppies are brought into prison and paired with specially trained inmates who take care of them for the next two years.  As the puppies grow up and become well-loved, well-behaved dogs, their inmate raisers learn what it means to give to society rather than take from it.  The puppies give love to their inmate raisers and then go out into the world to either serve disabled veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan or sniff for explosives in partnership with law enforcement in public places like airports.
mission: |
  The pups live in the cells with the inmates, go to weekly classes administered by Puppies Behind Bars, and are travel  two or three weekends a month to 'puppy sitters' who take the dogs into their homes in order to expose them to things they won't experience in prison. These can be as simple as hearing doorbells and as complex as learning how to ride in a car and walk down a crowded sidewalk. The puppies live in prison for sixteen months, after which they are tested to see if they can be trained as service dogs for the disabled. If they are deemed suitable, Puppies Behind Bars returns them to the schools where they continue their formal training. If they do not continue on the track to become working dogs, Puppies Behind Bars donates them to families with blind children. In either case, these puppies spend their lives as companions to people who need them.

  Hi, my name is Eric, and I work for Puppies Behind Bars, where I help raise money so that we can teach prison inmates how to train working dogs.  I love the fact that we have dogs in the office most days--four big Labrador retrievers. I have two big dogs of my own at home. We all really appreciate the hard work of the many students who have contributed to our program through Common Cents/Penny Harvest. THANK YOU.
