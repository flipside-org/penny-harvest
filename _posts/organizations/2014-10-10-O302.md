mission: |
  Comfort Zone Camp, a fun and safe place for grieving children, is the nation's largest bereavement camp for children who have experienced the loss of a parent, sibling or primary caregiver. Camps are held in Richmond, Virginia, and are open to all grieving children from across the country.

  The program was developed by grief therapists more than four years ago, strategically combining fun activities with more introspective times to help children grieve and begin mending their tender hearts. The idea is the brainchild of co-founders Lynne and Kelly Hughes. Lynne suffered the loss of both parents before the age of 12 and is personally aware of the challenges children face in their grief.
