  Our story Michael Gonzalez and Vanessa Polanco, Verde's owners, Creative Director and Account Director respectively, personify their company's South Bronx location. Sitting in the heart of the new 'it' place on the city's up-and-coming 'it' list, Michael and Vanessa embrace, contribute to and help lead the artist community, and welcome the area's urban beauty, diversity and roots. This new cultural mecca is a constant source of creative inspiration and personal source of pride. Watching the area evolve, take shape and become the best version of itself, parallels their own business and therefore the neighborhood's voice, humility and authenticity can always be seen in their work.
