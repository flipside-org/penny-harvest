  The Pets For the Elderly Foundation (PFE) is a non-profit organization that provides the gift of health and happiness to senior citizens in need, while saving the lives of dogs and cats – many of which are euthanized by animal shelters or pounds simply for lack of funds or space. More than six million animals are destroyed annually because homes are not available – making euthanasia of adoptable animals the number one cause of death for both dogs and cats. The most serious disease for older persons is not cancer or heart disease – it's loneliness. Pets offer affection, unconditional love, fight loneliness, and can help ease the loss of a loved one.
