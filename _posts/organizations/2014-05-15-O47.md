mission: |
  The American Cancer Society has been waging war against cancer for nearly a century, and our commitment to defeating the disease has never wavered. Our lifesaving efforts are funded exclusively by the generosity of donors like you. Since 1993 Making Strides Against Breast Cancer® has raised more than $100 million in additional funding to support the Society’s breast cancer research, education, advocacy, and patient services.
