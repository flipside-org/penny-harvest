mission: |
  The Hunger Project is a global, strategic organization committed to the sustainable end of world hunger.

  In Africa, Asia and Latin America, The Hunger Project empowers millions of women and men to end their own hunger. The Hunger Project has pioneered low-cost, bottom-up, gender-focused strategies in each region where hunger persists. These strategies mobilize clusters of rural villages to create and run their own programs that achieve lasting progress in health, education, nutrition and family income

    $500 could provide, on average, small loans to 10 African women and men. With these loans, women and men can improve their farms and grow more food for their families and communities. In addition, women and men often use their loans to start small businesses, such as pig-farming or tailoring, in their villages. Through their small businesses they earn more money which they can use to buy their families food and medicine and to send their children to school.

    $1000 could purchase a food processing machine which is very important for a community that is trying to end hunger. With a food processing machine, farmers can take the food from their fields and have it last longer and become more useful by processing it (for example, taking wheat and making it into flour).  With a processing machine, food that would normally go bad quickly can be preserved to last for many weeks or months.  That way, communities will have food available when their farms are not very productive. One food processing machine could help an entire community (as many as 10,000 people) avoid hunger.

    Doing a combination bake sale fundraiser/educational event at their school (for example, each item that is sold could have a label attached to it with some important statistics and facts about world hunger.) This would be beneficial in many ways, in that it will help The Hunger Project through the additional funds it raises and it will help educate the students who purchase the items because they will be learning about hunger as they fulfill their own hunger.

    Put together a “newspaper” on hunger and distribute to all kids in the school and parents. This would be empowering for the authors of the newspaper as they share the knowledge they have learned and would educate others.  It would also be helpful for The Hunger Project as it would help spread the news of our work and help broaden our name recognition.

  Hi! My name is Supriya Banavalikar, and I am from India. I have been working with The Hunger Project for the last 20 years.  I have played many roles here, but my most favorite one is to bring the stories and experiences of our village partners to people in countries where we raise money.  I travel to countries where The Hunger Project works and tell the villagers about their friends around the world.  Our work is about giving everyone a chance to build a better life for themselves and their children.
