description: |
  A.C.T.'s purpose is to respond to the needs of the many abandoned, stray and lost animals - regardless of breed, size, or personality and including very shy cats, and injured or ill cats. (Except FIV or leukemia positive cats, due to our lack of quarantine facilities.) ACT provides each animal with food, shelter, personal attention and medical treatment until a suitable, loving home is found - however long this takes. No animal is placed before neutering is done, or in the case of kittens, without follow-up and low-cost spay/neuter certificates to ensure this has been taken care of. 

  A.C.T. is an all-volunteer, not-for-profit organization that was incorporated in 1982 and is registered in New York State. ACT's volunteers do all the cleaning and maintenance of the shelter - including helping with adoptions and feeding - as well as caring for and working with the animals. We desperately need new volunteers. Our volunteers handle and socialize new kittens, provide attention, brushing and a soft lap to all of our residents. Some of our volunteers also provide temporary foster homes for needy cats.

    We rescued cats that were found after Hurricane Sandy and gave them medical care. Most recently we rescued a young cat that had burn marks on his paws. We are trying to find him a loving home.

  I am a volunteer at an animal shelter called "Animals Can't Talk". I spend time taking care of the cats and kittens who live at the shelter and try to find them good, loving homes. I also spend a few hours a week rescuing homeless/stray cats and kittens and getting them spayed/neutered.
