  The NRPA is a consortium of conservation groups, yacht clubs, sportsmen clubs, environmental groups and concerned citizens dedicated to the protection of the marine environment of Raritan Bay, and  Lower New York Harbor. Keeps constant vigilance on the proposed Dredged Material Management Plan of the Army Corps of Engineers to construct large toxic "containment islands" and fill "Borrow Pits" with toxic dredge spoils from the dredging of Newark Bay, home of the worst corporate polluters in the history of our nation. Battles against the dumping of toxic chemicals by large chemical corporations into the bay. The NRPA has fought against mechanical dredging for clams and oysters; worked for beach replenishment, jetties, fishing piers, public access, to stop pollution ,and a host of other environmental concerns effecting Lower New York Harbor, Raritan Bay, and the New York Bight.
