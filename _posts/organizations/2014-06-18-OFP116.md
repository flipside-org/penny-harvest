  Harlem has a long list of kids who desperately need help! The little things most folks take for granted, such as safe playgrounds or after school activities, most kids in Harlem don’t have access to. We at Harlem Children's Zone work to make life better for children and families in Harlem through a number of programs and services (community centers, after school programs, social services, health and recreational activities). We have 18 centers that serve more than 20,000 children and adults. With your pennies and your helping hands, you can help us rebuild the community.

  Hey there -- My name is Becky.  Before coming to HCZ in October 2012 I was a big fan of its work--especiallly its unique approach to education.  My intervening early in children's development and engaging the whole community, HCZ is radically changing the odds for the thousands of children in our Zone.
