mission: |
  Blacksmith works in highly polluted locations in the developing world with the intent of mitigating human health risks from pollution. Solutions to pollution problems vary according to each site and include factors such as:

  

      * The type of pollution (air, water, groundwater, soil, etc)

      * The toxins involved (particularly their potency and longevity)

      * The extent of the contamination

      * Whether it is active or "legacy" (abandoned or ownerless sites)

      * A variety of local geographical and political factors
