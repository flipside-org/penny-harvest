description: 
mission: |
  The Community Partnerships and The Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) work hand-in-hand with local community groups, faith-based institutions, non-profits and individuals in New York City neighborhoods to build a safety net for children and families. The Community Partnerships work with ACS to promote child safety and strengthen the community’s ability to keep children safe and support families. One of the Partnerships’ chief tasks is to help recruit strong and loving foster families in their neighborhoods. When families need help – and when children need safe and loving foster homes – the Community Partnerships are there to help.
