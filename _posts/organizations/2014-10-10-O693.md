mission: |
  It's tough growing up in New York City. Homicide is the leading cause of death for city children ages 15 to 19. 44 percent of New York City's children live in poverty and more than 43,000 New York City children are in foster care. Kids With a Promise seeks to be the promise that was never kept in the shattered lives of these children. We promise to love them unconditionally, to provide a nurturing environment, to challenge them to dream and equip them to achieve those dreams.
