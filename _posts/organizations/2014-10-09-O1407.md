mission: |
  Wildlife Conservation Network is dedicated to protecting endangered species and preserving their natural habitats.  We support innovative strategies for people and wildlife to co-exist and thrive.

  

  WCN fosters the entrepreneurial spirit in the field of conservation. We partner with independent, community-based conservationists around the world and provide them with the capital and tools they need to develop solutions for human-wildlife coexistence. To magnify the effectiveness of their work, we sustain a strong network of wildlife supporters though which these courageous conservationists may learn from each other and communicate directly with passionate donors.
