  Wyckoff's mission is "To provide excellence in care through prevention, education and treatment in a safe environment." We actively bring high quality health services, including educational and preventive services, directly into the community through our mobile Community Care Coach, our network of full-time and part-time clinics, and our special outreach programs such as the Asthma Awareness Program, the Diabetes Center of Excellence, the Prenatal Care Assistance Program (PCAP) and the Women, Infants and Children's (WIC) Program. Through these and other programs we specifically target important chronic health problems and issues facing our service area.
