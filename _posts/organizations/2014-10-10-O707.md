  Escuela Pacaja is a public elementary school in Quetzaltenango Guatemala. The school lacks basic necessities that the children could greatly benefit from. Our first project is to raise money so a library can be funded for the school. Throughout a week working there, not much literature was seen around the school. Every child deserves to cozy up with a good book and learn to love reading!

  The happiness that this would bring to those children would be invaluable.
