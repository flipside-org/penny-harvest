  The Humane Society of the United States works for the protection of all animals and fights animal cruelty and abuse in all of its forms. 

  Over the years, we’ve had great success for animals. Some of that success has been a result of the efforts of young people like you. For example, young people played a major role in the passage of a federal law to protect America’s wild horses and burros and in a campaign to protect dolphins from being caught in tuna fishing nets. While we’re proud of our successes, there is still much work to do. We hope you’ll come aboard and help us be a voice for animals.

    Care for Puppy Mill Victims

    You could pay for a rescued puppy mill dog to be cared for at an emergency shelter for a week, allowing us to provide crucial food, veterinary care, and socialization so we can place him in a loving home. Puppy mills are businesses that churn out puppies for sale at pet stores while their mommies and daddies are kept in awful conditions and provided not enough love or care.

    US$25.00

    Fuel an Anti-Poaching Patrol

    US$200.00

  Hi! I'm Patrick and I work to help pass laws on campaigns to protect animals as the New York State Director for The Humane Society of the United States.

  

  I've been involved in animal protection since I was 10 years old and was featured in The Humane Society's special newspaper for kids called "Kind News" when I was a student. 

  I am a native New Yorker who was born and raised in New York City. I attended PS130 in Chinatown, JHS 167 on the Upper East Side, Brooklyn Technical High School in Ft. Greene, and Hunter College, where I studied Political Science.
