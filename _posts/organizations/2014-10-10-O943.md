  The Food Pantry is a 25-year-old program, steeped in a rich cultural history. Coordinated and run entirely by students, it is the largest such Food Pantry in the country. Students meet every Wednesday to prepare packages and on Friday afternoons they hand them out to hundreds of local families in need.
