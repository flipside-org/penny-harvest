description: 
mission: |
  Promise of Play, Inc was founded to encourage people of all ages to maintain a youthful sense of enjoyment while simultaneously giving back to disadvantaged members of the community.

     "Play" is unique because it connects people from different ages, physical abilities and backgrounds, encouraging lasting and substantive relationships. We host events from the stage to the basketball court to the playground, building our community brick by plastic brick.

  

     We hold strongly that community respect and effective communication are crucial to the continuation and success of Promise of Play, Inc.. The most important desires of the organization are to facilitate and spread awareness about the importance of various forms of play activities, unite members of the community, and enact positive and lasting change through our efforts.
