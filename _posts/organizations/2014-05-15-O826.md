mission: |
  We are a not-for profit 501(c)3 organization supported solely by donations and modest fees, led by a volunteer board of trustees. We are committed to caring for all animals. 

  The Monmouth County SPCA not only finds homes for stray dogs and cats, but also those family pets that can no longer be cared for by their owners. All of the animals (strays and previously owned pets) placed for adoption receive the same excellent care. The MCSPCA is committed to preventing cruelty to animals, and we see to it that a human being responsible for cruelty to an animal is brought to justice.
