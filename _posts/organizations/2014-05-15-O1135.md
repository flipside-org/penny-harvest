description: 
mission: |
  Our mission is to help educate the children of traditional nomadic families in Northern Samburu. We work to help more Samburu children go to school and receive the level of education they desire, whether that is primary school, high school, technical school, or college. With hard work, resourcefulness, and a little help from the outside world, the Samburu people have begun to create significant, meaningful, and measurable change by providing education for their children. The Thorn Tree Project exists to do all it can to support their efforts.

  Our mission comes from the Samburu people themselves. It is a privilege to be invited into the Samburu tribe, and we make sure that everything we do is in tune with their culture and aligned with their goals. We aim to have the smallest possible footprint in Samburu, maintaining our focus on education.
