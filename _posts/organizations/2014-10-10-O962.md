  ...to Pennies for Peace, a program of Central Asia Institute <http://www.ikat.org> (CAI).

  Pennies for Peace educates American children about the world beyond their experience and shows them that they can make a positive impact on a global scale, one penny at a time.

  Our best hope for a peaceful and prosperous world lies in the education of all the worldâ€™s children. Through cross-cultural understanding and a solution-oriented approach, Pennies for Peace encourages American children, ultimately our future leaders, to be active participants in the creation of global peace.
