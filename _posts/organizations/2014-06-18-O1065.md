  The Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, Inc. (RBSCC) a 501(C)(3) non-profit was founded in 1973 as a senior service provider in the Ridgewood and Bushwick communities. In the years that have elapsed, RBSCC has grown tremendously and its mission has extended far beyond that of its early years. Today, our agency provides a vast array of social services to residents of all ages within the Bushwick, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Ridgewood, Glendale, and surrounding communities.
