  ·Strengthening parents’ skills in supporting their young child’s early language and literacy development

  ·Providing books to families with children ages 6 months through 5 years old to bring books into the home to keep.

  ·Providing families with opportunities for literacy activities through regular literacy programming and story telling by trained community volunteers ·Linking families to community literacy resources and services

    At every well-child visit from 6months - 5 years, ROR provides a brand new book for the family to take home.  Each year, we purchase over 14,000 books to meet the needs of the families we serve.  Every book costs about $3.00.  We would use your money to help purchase new books that we give to the children in our health centers.

    Volunteers who complete the Lutheran Family Health Centers’ enrollment and orientation process are eligible to become volunteer readers in the clinic waiting rooms.  Volunteers read aloud to the children, showing parents and children the pleasures and techniques of looking at books together.

    Other volunteer activities include: conducting a book drive, collecting gently used books to be read and given out in the waiting rooms, and unpacking and inventorying books.  Group fundraising projects (penny drives, ice cream socials, craft fairs, read-a-thons, etc.) are also appreciated.

  Hello - I am proud to say that our Sunset Park Reach Out and Read program has been on the ground promoting early literacy in southwest Brooklyn for almost 10 years!  We work to make sure that every family has a chance to read aloud to their child before they reach school.  Every penny helps us buy more books for our children!
