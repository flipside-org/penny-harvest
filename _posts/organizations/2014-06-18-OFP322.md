  Hi I'm Mariana,  thank you for viewing our page.  I am the social worker for The Salvation Army in Brownsville for 9 years.   I help people with food, help them pay their rent, furniture, and utilities, give clothes and toys.  Once before we worked with a school who was collecting pennies to help out the community with groceries.  When the people in the community received the canned goods and fresh frozen meat, and were told that it came from children, they were very happy and had a "Kool Aide" smile on their faces.   That day was "the BOMB" for them.  We hope you decide to work with us in feeding the community again.
