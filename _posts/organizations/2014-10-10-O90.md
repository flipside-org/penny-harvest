mission: |
  Any Soldier Inc. started in August 2003 as a simple family effort to help the soldiers in one Army unit, thus our name.  Read through the names and select the ones you wish to support. They list what they want and need. We even have a search capability so you can identify easily what the troops need most. All the soldiers involved in this effort are military volunteers stationed in areas that are in harm's way. You send your support (letters and/or packages) addressed to them and when they see the "Attn: Any Soldier" line in their address they put your letters and packages into the hands of soldiers who don't get much or any mail first. Everything is shared.
