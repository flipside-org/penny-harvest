  We work with young people and older people to find ways of talking to one another so we don't end up fighting or going to war. We help people to network together in peacemaking.

  In our youth program,Confronting Concerns, we interviewed 150 youth in New York City about their concerns for themselves , their neighborhood and the world.

  Our youth have presented workshops about these concerns: violence, drugs, sex, environment and racism. We are working to end human trafficking, a new form of slavery...

  I like working with youth.  It gives me a lot of hope and I like the freshness and new ideas that young people have and that they don't mind asking why?  I certainly am happy to see young people working to make a better society. You can go to our website if you want to learn more! www.networkforpeace.com
