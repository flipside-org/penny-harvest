  It is unfair that in one of the world’s richest cities, children don't have nice clothes to wear to school or even a warm winter coat.

  

  We provide new fashionable clothing that helps children fit in and allows them to focus on succeeding in school and in their future.

  

  HOW WE WORK: New clothing and toys are sorted and prepared to be given away at New York City Clothing Bank’s Brooklyn warehouse.  We than give it to 225 partner agencies come collect these items the same way you get money from your local bank.  The partners serve approximately 80,000 homeless and low-income men, women and children in all five boroughs, .  We also provide clothing to victims of emergencies such as fires, crane collapses to even planes landing in the Hudson River.
mission: |
  or over twenty years, New York City Clothing Bank has been the only program in New York City to distribute new apparel, toys and other goods to help New Yorkers in need through its Clothing Community Resource Center (CCRC). This new merchandise assists the City’s adult homeless and low income population in achieving self-sufficiency and the self-confidence necessary to find employment and housing. New fashionable clothing also helps to increase children’s self-esteem and allows them to focus on succeeding in school and in their future endeavors.

    For every $100 the NYC Clothing Bank can give clothing to a homeless shelter each season.  This is very important in September so the children at these shelters can have new clothes to go back to school. This is also very important in December so children at these shelters have new clothes for the holidays as well as toys.

    Sock drive.

    

    Children's clothing is the hardest donation to get.  To help us make sure we have enough children's clothing, we ask groups to collect new packages of children's socks and undergarments.  This group donation would then be directly delivered to a specific partner such as a family shelter.

  Hi, I am Luis Jimenez and I run the NYC Clothing Bank.  This organization allows me to help people help those less fortunate I am.  Several years ago my son talked me into doing a penny drive for his grammar school and it was the most fun I had helping children make a difference.
