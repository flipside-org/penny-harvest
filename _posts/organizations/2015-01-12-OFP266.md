Because of the way the sorting is done, we receive 8 cents instead of the typical 5 cents per can/bottle. There are several ways to help:

    Drop your cans and bottles at 3 Oakland Avenue anytime or drop them at any Goldstein Auto Group location. Hold a bottle drive and deliver the cans and bottles.  Volunteer to help sort the donated recyclables bottles and cans.  We provide all the necessary supplies and instructions to do the sortingoutdoors, on our grounds.
