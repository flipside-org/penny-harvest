  It's not fair that some children can't play sports simply because they don't have use of their legs or other parts of their body, or because they have difficulty understanding what to do. Project HAPPY is a sports program for young people who have disabilities. HAPPY Saturdays are the only time that they have the opportunity to enjoy the kinds of sports activities that the rest of us take for granted. They enjoy wheelchair basketball, bowling, dance, soccer, and swimming. With your pennies, you can help us make sure that these programs continue!

    Hurricane Sandy destroyed our bowling alley and severely damaged our swimming pool. The pool will be repaired eventually but the bowling alley is gone forever. The disabled children loved bowling and they are very sad to have lost that activity because of the hurricane. They keep asking when it will be fixed.

    We used special ramps for children who use wheelchairs, and special lightweight balls for children who are not able to lift a regular bowling ball. We would like to replace the activity with a portable, roll-out bowling lane and replacement ramps, balls, and pins. The cost of this would be about $1000.

  When I was born there was a popular song called "Pennies from Heaven", so my parents named me Penny after the song. That is one of the reasons I have a special affection  for the Penny Harvest Program. I have been the director of Project HAPPY since it stared thirty-

  two years ago.  At Project HAPPY I am lucky because I get to see people with disabilities learn to swim and play basketball and do all sorts of activities that they might not have a chance to do otherwise.
