description: 
mission: |
  Veterans are enrolled in the medical center's primary care program, which establishes one healthcare provider (MD, PA, NP) and team, to coordinate the patient's care. Inpatient and outpatient services are available in medicine, surgery, psychiatry, dermatology, rehabilitation medicine, pathology, nephrology, laboratory medicine and radiology. A house staff rotation in ambulatory care medicine and primary care pharmacy makes the medical center a preferred site for training medical students. The medical center maintains a Comprehensive Cancer Care Center providing highly integrated oncologic, surgical and state-of-the-art radiotherapy services. A Women's Healthcare Center, with a mammography unit, exists offering comprehensive medical services to female veterans.
