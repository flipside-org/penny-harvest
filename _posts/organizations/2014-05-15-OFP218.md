  Pratt Area Community Council (PACC) is a non-profit organization that helps to serve residents in Fort Greene, Clinton Hill and Bedford- Stuyvesant neighborhoods in South Brooklyn.  PACC provides services that help low-income residents purchase or rent affordable housing units and helps them deal with landlord or repair issues.  In addition to this, PACC provides classes that offer financial, homeowner and business educational workshops.  PACC also provides resources such as grants, and low interest loans to home buyers, homeowners and small business owners.  All in all, PACC strives to improve the quality of living for residents and revitalize the communities of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill and Bedford Stuyvesant.
mission: |
  PACC’s role is of critical importance to neighborhood stability in the face of shrinking housing subsidies, tenant displacement, overcrowding, building neglect, and rising home prices.  PACC’s community organizers encourage and mobilize local residents to improve their surroundings and confront broader concerns such as environmental hazards, code enforcement and rent regulation.  Through our tenant counseling and support services, we address day-to-day problems, while also helping residents address issues that affect their lives

    PACC works in several program areas including business assistance to small businesses on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, social services, assistance for first time home buyers and developing affordable housing.  In particular, PACC would appreciate student funding for our tenant counseling sessions geared towards preventing eviction or getting repairs.   A $150 grant will help fund a counseling session, provide referrals to legal resources and support in dealing with city agencies and landlords.

    The second ongoing project that PACC could use student assistance in is providing technical assistance to small merchants and businesses. A donation of $150 would provide merchants with business retention and attraction strategies.

    Every year around Earth Day, PACC, and its division of young adult members, Young Friends of PACC (YFOP), get together to plant trees, plants and flowers around some of PACCs properties.  This would be a wonderful opportunity for students to not only help PACC maintain the appearance of their properties but it will also help the environment as well. This year we held one tree planting day but we are interested in holding at least two next year in 2011.

    This is the first year that PACC is trying to organize a free book drive for the children of residents of PACC properties.  The goal is to have this book drive take place in the end of August 2010 or early September 2010.  The purpose of this book drive is not only to encourage children to read more but also to prepare them for the upcoming school year.
