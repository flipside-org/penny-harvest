  The Children's Aid Society, founded in 1853, is a New York City organization that serves more than 70,000 children and their families each year, often helping them overcome tremendous odds. Our network of more than 100 cutting-edge programs and services provided at over 40 sites in and around New York City supplies a full spectrum of support. Our services cover the following areas: Adolescent Development, Mentoring and Support, Adoption & Foster Care, Arts and Recreation. We offer the children of New York City Summer Day Camps in Manhattan, Westchester and Staten Island,  community schools that offer public education with a wide range of vital in-house health and social services to ensure that children are physically, emotionally and socially prepared to learn and Community Centers that provide a range of programs and services under a single roof -- from social, cultural and emotional support, to preschool, after-school and career training programs, recreation, child care and health services. In addition to these vital programs we also provide four types of health services - Medical, Dental, Mental Health and facilitated healthcare enrollment and Pelham Fritz Transitional Housing for homeless families; Our PINS program (Persons in Need of Supervision) and our juvenile justice help keep children out of the judicial system; and our 70 year old Family Homemaker Services, the oldest existing homemaker program in the country, offers support to families who experience crises that threaten their ability to stay together and safe -- it is a very specialized service and one of the few still operating today.   Our nationally recognized programs are models of social service practice and have impacted national child welfare policy.

  I have had the privilege of working at The Children's Aid Society for almost 6 years, in the role of Manager of Annual Giving for going on 3 years. Before my job here at the main office, I was lucky enough to work at one of our amazing centers that had early childhood, nursery school, after school and a Saturday Program for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children and Teens. I have had the wonderful privilege to visit many of our sites and see many of our programs, staff and children in action. It is my job here at Children's Aid's main office to reach out to our many wonderful donors to ask them to donate, thank them for donating and try and educate others about all tha we do. I am also lucky that I have become the agency's poing person for the Penny Harvest initiatives. I really enjoy and am always inspired while I get to travel around New York City's five boroughs, visit schools and talk with students about how they can make a difference and all of Children's Aid's programs that need their help.
