  The Ananda & Johnny Program, Inc., (A&J) is a not-for-profit public chartiy. The goal of this program is so simple and sweet that we wonder why no one thought of it before: to provide inner city children with companion dogs that have been rescued from shelters.

  This project is designed to benefit both populations. The dogs, who might otherwise be euthanized, will find good homes. And the children and their families will discover the joys of caring for a loving animal while still being able to afford the expense involved in such care. A&J will see to that, providing training for the dogs and consultation and assistance to the families. More importantly, the children will learn what dogs have been teaching kids of all cultures for generations: self esteem, responsibility and empathy.
