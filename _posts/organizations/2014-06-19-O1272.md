mission: |
  Teen Challenge is a faith-based organization that provides residential treatment of drug and alcohol addiction for men and women. Teen Challenge provides 12-month residential programs in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. Daily activities include classes in a faith-based curriculum, one-to-pne counseling sessions and group counseling. We also have an after school program for children grades 1-7. The goal of the After School program is to provide homework assistance, computer training and mentoring with lots of love so we can reach kids before they fall into the traps of addiction. In addition we provide crisis counseling, drug prevention seminars, and sexual abuse seminars.
