  Our organization exists to help children with cancer. We raise money through events to give dollars to doctors for pediatric cancer research so that children and their families can live normal lives.
mission: |
  The Pediatric Cancer Foundation, was founded in 1970 by grateful parents whose son underwent surgery and treatment at Babies Hospital, New York. Today PCF has grown to support children and their families afflicted with all types of cancer. Three decades of support has enabled the foundation to purchase state of the art equipment, support research projects and bring exceptional fellows to both the surgical and oncology departments.
