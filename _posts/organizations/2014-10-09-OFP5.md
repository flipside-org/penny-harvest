    Girls Education! Last year, we created education opportunity to rural village girls in South Sudan. Over 90% of girls in South Sudan dont have access to education and they are being demoted by their parents. Through our project, we educate their parents first to understand the importance of education for their daughters and families.

  I am Dominig Diing, Aid and Care's founder, Inc. I am one of the former lost boy of Sudan.  I founded this organization in 2006 and I have been dedicated my time to its success since its inception in that year. I do fundraising toward this organization and trip to Africa every year to see the work done where we help. I am currently academic coach at Buffalo Public Schools; providing academic support to the refugee populations in schools and community. 

    More than any else, I do speaking engagement and I have been speaking in churches, schools, clubs, and family gathering share my life story. I also share with people and organizations like Penny Harvest the good work we do through Aid and Care.  Recently we have changed Aid and Care name to Kusaidia Afrika. I am so blessed that I have very good friends who share the same vision as I am. I sincerely thanks Penny Harvest for the great support. Together we can change this world to a better world.

  

  

  May God bless you for helping the abandoned children of Africa and other world.
