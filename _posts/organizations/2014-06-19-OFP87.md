  We are a twenty-five year old charity that helps find permanent loving adoptive homes for older children and teens who sit in the foster care system, desperate for the "forever family" that is every child's right.
mission: |
  FAMILY FOCUS ADOPTION SERVICES was founded in 1987, and continues to be board administered and staffed by many adoptive parents. FAMILY FOCUS is a not-for-profit, fully accredited multi-service adoption agency. Our administrative offices are located in Eastern Queens, New York, with satellite offices in Albany and Newburgh. While we place children from anywhere in the United States, we only license families from the twenty-one counties from the Capital District through Metropolitan New York and Long Island. Our agency is also approved in New Jersey and Connecticut.

  

  Whether you are searching for a baby or an older child in New York, throughout the United States, or internationally, FAMILY FOCUS ADOPTION SERVICES believes you deserve timely and comprehensive adoption services.

  

  Our goal is, very simply, "For every child a permanent home..."

    We will use a Penny Harvest grant to purchase books to educate adoptive families about the foster children's experiences.  We believe that when parents understand what their children have gone through in foster care, they will be better parents. There are two memoirs written by adults who grew up as foster children that we wish to purchase for our families.  They are: "Three Little Words" by Ashley Rhodes-Courter and "Etched in Sand" by Regina Calcaterra. $250 would enable us to purchase ten copies of each book.

contact_person_intro: |
  I am a mother of two young adult sons and have worked as a social worker for Family Focus since my children were babies.  I help  families who are adopting older children from the foster care system who have no permanent family to call their own.  I love to see how children grow and thrive once they have a "forever" adoptive family.
