description: 
mission: |
  The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is a 35-bed Regional Perinatal Center (the highest designation for recognizing the ability to care for the most complex patients and provide consultation to other neonatal units in the region). Each year there are more than 700 admissions to the NICU, with approximately 10 percent of the infants being transferred from other institutions. 

  Our families tell us that the unique feature of the NICU is its unswerving dedication to remaining "family-centered". With two full-time social workers on-staff, we can assure the help and resources families require during stressful times. We make our "nesting room"--a private, hotel-like bedroom--available to families prior to discharge to practice caring for their infants in a safe, less intense environment.
