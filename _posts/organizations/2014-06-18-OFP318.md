    No Beef Thursdays is a 3-year-old initiative that features free youth programming and a healthy meal for youth from 11-21 years of age.  This highly collaborative evening features POINT programming in poetry alongside Urban Word NYC, academic tutoring with New York Cares, social circus programming with Cirque du Monde (Cirque du Soleil youth program), in-house music production in our Music Studio, and a community meal alongside Bascom Catering and the  Parsons School of Design that feeds well over 75 young people per week.  This evening was created to provide a safe space for young people to interact positively through the arts and academics, as well as as through sitting down for a larger community meal.  No Beef Thursdays encourages youth to come as they are and opens opportunities for them to join other year round initiatives at our site.  Any amount of funding will go directly to purchasing food.

  My name is Danny R Peralta, and as the Director of Arts and Edcuation, it is my duty to provide programming opportunities for up to 500 students a year in over 25 different projects.  Being born in the Bronx, I know firsthand the importance of having positive spaces for youth to grow up in.  I too am a product of THE POINT as I joined the black and white photography program in 2003 and have since been featured in magazines and exhibits.  I know how magicalÂ and unique THE POINT is in changing peoples perceptions of the South Bronx.
