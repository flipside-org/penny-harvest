  Do you know anyone, or do you have a friend, who sometimes needs extra help learning or socializing? Most of us do.

      The Staten Island Mental Health Society is there to assist these children and teenagers who have special needs. We provide programs and supportive services for Staten Island youngsters with emotional problems, developmental disabilities,  educational weaknesses, and/or economic disadvantages, as well as for their families. Our 21 award-winning programs,  at 25 locations throughout the Island, assisted more than 5,000 children last year.

     Our services include counseling, special education, after-school and summer programs, drug and alcohol prevention and treatment, academic tutoring, child abuse prevention, parent skills training, and Head Start and daycare centers for preschoolers from needy families.

      We also run two volunteer programs for mainstream children who may be suffering from low self-esteem. Those who need extra help learning to read benefit from our School Reading Volunteer Program, while our Staten Island Children's Theatre Association brings children's cultural arts to our borough and offers training in musical theatre.  
mission: |
  The SIMHS is a century-old, not-for-profit children's services agency. Our mission is to diagnose and treat emotional, behavioral, organic, and developmental problems; to create and support programs and environments that reduce the risk of disability and advance the optimal development of children; to increase our knowledge of the causes and treatments of mental illness and developmental impairment; and to promote public awareness of, and support for, the value and availability of our services.

    Can you imagine not being able to read? Hundreds of  elementary school children in Staten Island have difficulty learning to read, causing them to have no self-confidence, which may result in bad behavior and other problems. Why? They may be recent immigrants with limited knowledge of English. They may have minor learning problems, suffer from emotional stress,  or come from troubled families.     Our School Reading Volunteers often come to the rescue!  Our trained volunteer reading tutors go into the schools for twice-weekly one-on-one sessions with these children, who benefit greatly from this service.

         In fact, more than 250 school reading volunteers assisted more than 500 children in 35 public schools last year, most of them in first to third grade. The children not only learn to read, but learn to love reading,  which gives them more self-confidence, improves their behavior and makes them better all-around friends and classmates.

        Because the School Reading Volunteer Program receives no government funding, we depend upon private grants and donations to provide funds for books and other materials that the volunteers use in their tutoring sessions with the children. These books and materials are recommended by the professional reading teacher who trains the volunteers.      Every $10 of a Penny Harvest grant could buy some of the following for our reading volunteers to share with their students, thus making their tutoring sessions more productive and more fun:  children's books, flash cards, a puzzle, a notebook, bookmarks, construction and drawing paper or markers.     Without funding assistance,  the reading volunteers must depend on the limited inventory of school libraries or teachers for books, and usually purchase supplies themselves, for which they cannot be reimbursed.

    Although elementary school students are too young to be reading volunteers (required age is at least 18) upperclassmen could act as escorts for the younger children when they go to meet their tutors in other parts of the school (lunchroom, gym, empty classroom).

        A schoolwide book collection drive would be of direct  benefit to the reading volunteer program by providing books for the children. The books would not have to be new, just in good condition.

        We would notify the Staten Island Advance about this campaign and request a photo op/news item, which would be good public relations for your school.

    The Staten Island Mental Health Society also operates two thrift shops, in Great Kills and Tottenville (Staten Island). The shops are staffed and managed by volunteers. The shops sell gently used clothing, accessories and housewares at very low prices and all proceeds benefit our wide range of services for children with special needs.

          A schoolwide clothing/ housewares drive, where children could bring in items from home to be donated to one or both thrift shops, would benefit the agency as a whole, and thus the children we serve.

        As above, we would notify the Staten Island Advance about this service campaign, thus affording your school good publicity.

  As Director of Community Relations, it is my job to go out into the community and tell people  about the important work done by the Staten Island Mental Health Society. I often go to schools and PTA meetings to help parents and children find out about our services.  As a former teacher, I love visiting schools and meeting children and I have worked with Common Cents schools in the past,  many of which have our Reading Volunteer Program in their schools. I am delighted and honored to say that we have been granted Penny Harvest funds for this program in the past. I thank the schools and the students for helping the SIMHS help children who have special needs. The grants help us live up to our promise to them: "We're here when you need us."
