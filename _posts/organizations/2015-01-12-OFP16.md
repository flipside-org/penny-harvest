  The American Lung Association was established to help people with lung disease lead heathier lives and prevent people from getting sick with lung diseases like asthma and diseases caused by cigarette smoking or air pollution.   We offer programs to help adults and children learn about asthma, avoid cigarettes and clean up the air.  Additionally, we support research into the causes of different kinds of lung diseases so doctors can improve treatment and hopefully, stop certain diseases.

    Each year, the Lung Association helps more than 5,000 children who have asthma learn how to better manage their disease by offering the Open Airways For Schools program in all elementary schools in New York City.    Kids between the ages of 8 and 11 participate in the six lesson program taught by their school nurse.    They learn how to recognize their asthma symptoms and avoid asthma triggers, as well as how to feel more confident managing their illness and taking their medications.   The result is that graduates from the Open Airways program learn that asthma is treatable and that kids with asthma can have a normal, healthy and active lives.

  My name is Louise Vetter and I am the Chief Executive Officer of the American Lung Association of New York.  I have worked here for for nine years, and I love my job.  When I was three years old, I was diagnosed with asthma, and I still have to take medicine everyday to be able to breathe.   Working at the American Lung Association enables me to make a difference in the lives of families like my own who have asthma and are fighting for air.
