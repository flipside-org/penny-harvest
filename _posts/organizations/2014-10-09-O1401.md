  West End Intergenerational Residence, (WIR), is a unique mixed-age housing facility catering to three generations. Through comprehensive development programs, we are able to prepare homeless young women with children, for effective lives as parents and as contributing members of society. In addition, WIR provides dignified affordable housing with supportive services to formerly homeless and low-income older adults.
