  Imagine always being scared, running in the streets in the bitter cold and stifling heat, with no home, no food and nothing to drink and sometimes very sick!  That's how over 2,500 of our rescues were found and saved.  But, as they enter our sanctuary doors, the abandoned strays are no longer homeless, helpless, or unwanted, but are beautiful living beings treasured and loved forever.   Cats Purrfect Rescue is Never Kill Shelter that nutritiously feeds and provides medical care for over 280 stray animals each day, that  includes mostly cats, dogs or any other animal we rescue that is in need of help.  There are 30+ animals at our sanctuary that are not adoptable because they are sick and need medication and constant daily attention, 200 more animals, make up the 33 outdoor sheltered colonies that we feed each day,  six fulltime volunteers foster and socialize 50 animals altogether at their homes everyday, as each stray is readied for adoption.  In addition, we are helping a poor elderly gentleman feed and medically care for his 30 rescues in upstate,  NY.   No stray is ever left behind for economic or any other reason. Cats Purrfect Rescue helps those individuals and families in dire need, who cannot pay for their pets treatment, who seek our assistance,  with veterinary bills, medications and food for their pets,  thus insuring that families and pets remain together in their loving companion relationships, despite their financial crisis.  We are honored to have the opportunity to make the difference in so many lives.  
mission: |
  Cats Purrfect Rescue's lifetime fulltime mission, since 1976, can best be described as on ongoing one of Never Kill, hands on, 24/7, animal welfare organization, specific to the prevention of cruelty to abandoned/neglected/forgotten feline/canine strays(or any other living creature in need of help), through relentless rescues, immediate spay/neuter, optimal, total medical care and ideal permanent placement.  Those felines deemed non adoptable, feral, socially withdrawn/ medically/physically challenged, become lifetime sanctuary residents (always 30 in #).  In addition, 200+ strays in 33 outdoor sheltered colonies are fed and provided with constant medical care daily, while our 6 fulltime volunteers foster 50 rescues collectively, as each is readied for adoption. Over 280 animals are entrusted to our care and support daily, as we continue to feed and provide all medical services for an additional 30 documented animals upstate. No stray is ever left behind for economic or any other reason.

    The cost to feed over 280 animals daily is from $125.00 to $150.00 each day.  Some animals require special food for special medical conditions.   A grant of $150.00 would pay for one day's food.  Monthly expenses currently are $10,000.00, conservatively with a high end of $22,600.00.   This amount increases with the number of rescues, unforeseen emergency expenses incurred by Tourniquet residents and new admits/victims of disasters, such as surgeries in specialized veterinary centers, medications, chronic conditions and or escalation in operational costs.  IRS returns continue to document 93% of revenue expended directly on the program, that is the care of the animals.  The remaining 7% is utilized for fundraising, postage, computer paper and ink for flyers.

    Veterinary medical costs can range from hundreds of dollars daily to many thousands, depending on the number of new admits, emergency surgeries, spays/neuters, vaccinations, deworming, treatment of fleas and other parasites and tests foor certain diseases.  A grant of $200.00 would pay for 2 spays/neuters and vaccinations at a low cost center. Surgeries for animals that we rescue with serious medical issues, cost thousands of dollars.  All of my salaries as a speech therapist with the Board of Education from were spent on saving animals.  Now my pension pays for bills that are not covered by contributions.

    The students can greatly help our strays, by participating in SERVICE PROJECTS which includes:  CLIPPING DOG AND CAT FOOD/LITTER COUPONS in newspapers and magazines and forwarding them to us, so we can conserve on food costs for over 280 + animals daily and or SELECTING A NAME OF CHOICE FOR ONE OR MORE OF OUR MANY STRAY RESCUES.

    The students can create letter size posters to be showcased in CATS PURRFECT RESCUE fundraising brochures, allowing for creativity in a community service activity, exercising the child's imagination, while incorporating writing and artistic skills.  Some students might prefer to cut out and paste pictures to explain their poster's theme and text.
