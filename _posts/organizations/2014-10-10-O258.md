  Children’s Cancer Research Fund, a national nonprofit 501 (c)3, supports the pioneering efforts at the University of Minnesota in research related to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cure of childhood cancers.

  

  Many discoveries funded by Children’s Cancer Research Fund have revolutionized the way childhood cancer is treated worldwide and helped to support quality-of-life programs for pediatric cancer patients and their families.

  

  We invest in the research areas that will have the most impact in the pursuit of better cures and treatments for children with cancer. Here are just a few of the ways we are making strides:
