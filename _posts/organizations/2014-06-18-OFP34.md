  At Autism Speaks, our goal is to change the future for all who struggle with autism spectrum disorders.

   We are dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments, and cure for autism; to raising public awareness about autism and its effects on individuals, families, and society; and to bringing hope to all who deal with the hardships of this disorder. We are committed to raising the funds necessary to support these goals.

   Autism Speaks aims to bring the autism community together as one strong voice to urge the government and private sector to listen to our concerns and take action to address this urgent global health crisis. It is our firm belief that, working together, we will find the missing pieces of the puzzle.

    Although our NYC Walk is held every spring, your Penny Harvest donations can be credited to your own Walk Team. Your Team can represent your school at the walk with your school's banner and own team t-shirt. Participants will also be invited to attend our Kick-off luncheons and receive an award at our Awards Reception.

    Another great way to help us spread the word is to get other schools involved too. Getting other schools in your district to help you fundraise and together, we can go to those schools and host an autism awareness day talking about what autism is, the newest breakthroughs in research, how you can help to make a difference.
