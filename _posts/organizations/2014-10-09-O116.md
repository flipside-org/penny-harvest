  BARCâ€™s mission is to provide a safe haven for abandoned animals and to find permanent loving homes for them. While in our care, we provide them with quality food, shelter, medical attention, and the love they deserve. We are a 501c3 not-for-profit, no-kill, privately run animal shelter located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
