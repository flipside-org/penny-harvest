  Society of St. Vincent is an organization dedicated to helping those most in need- the poor.  We help many needy New York families through our Food Pantry Network, our Holiday Meal Program at Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, and provide 400 New York City kids an opportunity to attend camp for 1 week.  We also provide burial assistance for those needy families who otherwise could not afford a burial for their loved ones.  The Society of St. Vincent  De Paul's mission is to embrace the world in a network of charity.  We aim to help those who are in need.

    Summer Camp Program:  This is an opportunity for needy New York kids to experience the camp experience for one week.  The camper non refundable registration fee is $50, and the Society supplements the remaining balance. $50 = 1 kid at camp.  $500 grant = 10 kids, $500 grant = 14 kids, and a grant of $980 would provide a camp experience for 28 deserving kids!

    Backpacks for school; We purchase backpacks and other school supplies for students returning to school in the Fall. Each child is given a backpack and school supplies, a total cost of $50.00 per child. A $500.00 grant will purchase a backpack and supplies for 10 children.

  Hi everyone, my name is Pattie Hughes, I am the President of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in the City of NY.  The members of SVdP call ourselves Vincentians, we are know to roll up our sleeves and get dirty! We serve those in need by cooking for them, making beds for them at our shelters and just sitting quietly with them, if that's what they need. We haven't had the opportunity to work with Penny Harvest schools in the past but I hope that in the coming years our work for the poor will be considered for partnerships.
