    Providing civics and/or English instruction to immigrants or a family education program costs $100-$200 a class/session depending on hours so a $1000 grant will fund 6-10 classes.

    Multicultural programs such as storytelling will cost $600 for four sessions including a showcase for the community.

    Providing extra food for those clients with specific dietary needs costs $100 to feed 5 people so a $100 grant would cover food for 5 meals for 5 people depending on the particular need.

    Our conversation partner program links volunteers with learners who want to improve their English.  Thus far we have served adults with  a few college students helping in the past.  Right now we meet with participants on Monday evenings from 7:15-8:15pm in Flushing.  Other groups are possible.
