description: 
mission: |
  International Crisis Aid's mission is to assist in sustaining life, bring encouragement to those suffering and collaborate with other relief organizations in bringing necessary foods, materials and medicines to people in times of crisis, particularly where life and death situations exist. Additionally, we attempt to bring public awareness to these situations and to solicit citizen involvement whenever and wherever possible. All assistance and resources are traditionally secured in the country of need when possible, so as to develop relations with the local business people and foster a true spirit of cooperation. Demonstrating God's love and care for people is our highest and most cherished goal. To accomplish this vision we will continue to target our efforts in "no-go zones" where other organizations cannot or will not go. Frequently this means taking on escalated risks.
