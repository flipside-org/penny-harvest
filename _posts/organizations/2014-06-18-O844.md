  Muffins Pet Connection, established in 1988, is a Non-Profit Community Animal Service Organization that we named after Muffin, a little stray dog who changed our lives forever. Muffins provides a Discount Spay/Neuter Certificate Program with 79 Participating Vets in NYC. Muffins has assisted pet owners and rescuers in finding homes for 7700 pets including thousands of cats, dogs, puppies, kittens. Homes have been found also for ferrets, guinea pigs, rabbits, turtles, hamsters, birds and iguanas. Many of these pets would have been in kill shelters or on the street. The pet owner or rescuer must be able to hold on to the pet until a home is found.
