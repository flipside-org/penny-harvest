  Since my name is Millicent (Milli-Cent), clearly my program is a perfect partner for Penny Harvest?.

  

  As the Director of Volunteer Services with Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, I specialize in securing resources--volunteers, donations, services-- for homeless and formerly homeless clients who haven't the money, skills, training, or physical well-being to get the things that they need for a better life.
