mission: |
  Our mission is to break the cycle of violence against children. We work to eliminate behaviors that keep children from reaching their potential. We redefine parenting by promoting positive changes in parenting and family attitudes, along with behaviors and prevention strategies through public education. Love Our Children USA works to empower and support children, teens, parents and families through information, resources, advocacy and online youth mentoring.
