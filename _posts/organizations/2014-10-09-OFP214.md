  Plan International USA is an international development organization, meaning that we partner with communities in developing countries to help them escape extreme poverty. Here in the U.S., we work with students and teachers to raise awareness of global issues, like poverty and children's rights, and we turn local service into global impact through our youth-led campaigns.
mission: |
  Plan USA strives to achieve lasting improvements in the quality of life of deprived children in developing countries by:

  

      * Enabling deprived children, their families and their communities to meet basic needs and to increase their ability to participate in and benefit from their societies;

      * Fostering relationships to increase understanding and unity among peoples of different cultures and countries; and

      * Being an advocate for the rights and interests of the world’s children.
