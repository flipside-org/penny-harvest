  UCC works to help people in East New York solve problems we see in our community by working together. One of our programs is the East New York Farms! project, where  we work with youth and adults to grow fresh, healthy food for our community.
mission: |
  United Community Centers is a neighborhood-based, multi generational, multi service organization that seeks to:

  

      * Provide first-rate services that meet the needs of the community

      * Involve residents of all ages in social efforts to learn about and resolve community problems

  

  We are open to anyone, although most of the people we serve live in East New York. We strive to create programs that recognize and value the "richness of difference" within both our community and the world at large.

    We are seeking $990 to fund our Summer Cooking program. 33 teens in our internship program (ages 13-18) rotate through cooking lunch for the rest of the group, using fresh and affordable ingredients from our farm, and learning how to prepare their own affordable, healthy meals. 9 weekly lunches throughout the summer cost about $110 each.

    We are seeking $1100 to fund stipends for 10 Community Educators to lead cooking demonstrations at Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) centers throughout East New York. Community Educators are residents who are trained in teaching about healthy, seasonal eating and where to find fresh food in our community. They lead demonstrations at WIC centers inform women with young children about our farmers market.
