  When children get cancer it affects the whole family so Hope & Heroes makes it possible to treat the whole child and the whole family. Funds raised touch every aspect of the children's cancer program at Columbia University Medical Center in upper Manhattan. From scientific research to programs that give kids and their families access to massage, acupuncture, aromatherapy and other helpful treatments, there are many ways that Hope & Heroes helps.

    Children with cancer (and their siblings) can spend a lot of time in the hospital and need lots of things to make their time here more fun. Toy drives can help make sure that we have goodies to give them when times get hard.

  I'm the Executive Director, which means the ultimate responsibility for running the organization lies with me. I've worked at Hope & Heroes since 2005 and I love it! Not only do I enjoy doing good in the world by helping children and families but I also have a personal reason for getting involved: my first child had a brain tumor. Even though we weren't able to successfully treat him, I knew that helping other families who were dealing with childhood cancer was what I wanted to do.
