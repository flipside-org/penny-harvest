  Being in the hospital can be very frightening for children and their families. The Child Life program at Maimonides Medical Center helps children and their families understand why they are in the hospital and what tests and procedures they may have to have done.  The child life program also offers recreational activites to help pass the time while the children have to stay in the hospital.  We have a 25 bed General Pediatric unit and an 11-bed Intensive Care Unit. We have a playroom and teen room which offer  open art activities, movies, toys, video games, computers, and much more.  Child life specialists provide supportive counseling for groups and individuals, pain management/ relaxation techniques, medical education, therapeutic medical play, procedural support and preparation for medical experiences, and art and play activities.  We have a Kids Kicking Cancer Support Group, a support group for parents whose children have cancer, as well as a pre-op program to help prepare children and families coming to our hospital to have surgery.

  Hi My name is Lenia (rhymes with kenya).  Coming to the hospital can be very scary for kids.  My job is to help make it less scary by explaining why a child is in the hospital and what tests and medications they may have done.  We always need new materials for our playrooms.  We have gotten some Common Cents grants in the past to buy a lot of wonderful toys, video games and books. I would love to give your group a tour so you can see our hospital and playroom and learn more about our program.
