  JDRF was founded in 1970 by some parents of kids with diabetes. Since it began, JDRF has only been about one thing: finding a cure for diabetes.  Many children with type 1 Diabetes rely on insulin to manage the disease but insulin is not a cure and it does not prevent the disease or its devestating effects, which can include kidney failure, blindness,and even heart disease.

  JDRF's mission is to find a cure for diabetes and its complications through the support of research and lots of it!

  My name is Liana Wilson and I work in the Individual Gift Giving Dept. Although Jdrf is new to Common Cents, I am quite familiar because I have two children who attend NYC Public Schools and have prticipated several times. JDRF is an excellent choice for your giving because Juvenile Diabetes directly affects children, perhaps someone you know or attend school with. Our organization is a non profit so our research relies on donations and every little bit counts! ;)
