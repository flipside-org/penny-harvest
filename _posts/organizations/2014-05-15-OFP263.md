  Hi guys!  My name is Dana Pirulli and I'm an Agency Administrator at Search and Care.  I've been working here for over 5 years--yep, seems like a long time, but it really isn't.  Even though I haven't worked with Common Cents, I would love to start as this is our first time working with you.  It would really give us a great opportunity to get to know you and for you to get to know us--especially our elderly population!
