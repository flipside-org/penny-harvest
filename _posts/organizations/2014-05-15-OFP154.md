  Our mission is to provide supportive services to families of children diagnosed with a brain or spinal cord tumor, before surgery, during the hospital stay, and after the children returns home, to help them cope with the fear, anxiety and stress of hospitalization, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation while funding research that will lead to a cure.

    We have a program that provides art therapy to children who are receiving treatment in the clinic.  These kids are very ill and sometimes have to be at the clinic all day receiving chemo and visiting the doctor.  The art program really cheers them up and makes their long days at the hospital much easier.  We can use some help in raising money for art supplies.  $1,000 per year is needed.

    Sometimes children with brain and spinal cord tumors are at the clinic for a long time getting their medicine and treatment.  We provide a yoga instructor to visit the kids and help them deal with their pain and stress.  This can really make them feel much happier as they work on getting cured of their illness.  $2,000 is needed for her supplies.

  Hello. My name is Catherine Lepone and I work at the Making Headway Foundation. I have worked with many charities over the years and Making Headway is the most special so far.  I love helping children who are sick so that they feel the support and love of others while they are fighting whatever is making them ill.
