mission: |
  STANDUP FOR KIDS helps homeless youth tackle some of their everyday obstacles and work towards a life off the streets. From basic necessities such as food, clothing, and hygiene to resources for housing, employment, and education, STANDUP FOR KIDS counselors use an open, straightforward and caring counseling approach to help kids reach their full potential.

  

  STANDUP FOR KIDS also developed the Don’t Run Away Program which targets youth at risk for running away. The Don’t Run Away Program is used to educate elementary and junior high students on the different resources and options available to remove themselves from abusive situations and deter them from running away. The Don’t Run Away Program is developing within established programs and extends to local clubs at high schools and universities across America.
