  Our organization exists to rescue dogs that are in desperate need of help and place them in loving homes. There are so many homeless dogs in our area, our city shelters are too full to deal with them all. Many wonderful dogs are being overlooked just because there are so many, we try to rescue these dogs. Although we are primarily a dog rescue group we have two colonies of feral cats which we take care of. All of the cats have been spayed/neutered and we watch carefully for new comers that are lured by the food we provide. If there is a new cat, we will trap it, have it vetted and if friendly we will find it a wonderful home. 
mission: |
  For Our Friends is a not-for-profit dog rescue group. We do not have a shelter of our own so we do a combination of foster homes and boarding. Our mission is to rescue as many stray or abused dogs as we can afford to do and find them the loving homes we deserve. We also rescue dogs that are being overlooked in our city shelters. We rescue many older dogs and place them with our senior citizens. We keep in close contact with our senior adopters, providing trips to the vet or whatever else is necessary. Every dog we rescue is given a complete medical exam and treated for any illness it might have. Every dog is spayed/neutered as soon as its help will allow.

    Every dog we rescue is given a complete medical exam and treated for any illness it might have. Every dog is given all of its required shots and spayed or neutered. Female dogs are spayed, male dogs are neutered. Every dog is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks before it can go into a foster home. We do not have foster homes for all the dogs we rescue and some dogs remain in boarding. Although we receive a 50% discount it is still costly. Not every dog gets adopted immediately, some are ill and require more care. It costs at least #300.00 to save a dog, that is just for the first two week. If we receive a grant of $300.00 you an sponsor a dog. We will tell you all about the dog, sent you photos of the dog or dogs whose life you have saved and let you know about the happy home we find for it.

    Unfortunately we really don't have a project that the students can be involved in because we do not have a shelter of our own. Also we can't accept volunteers under the age of 18 to handle the dogs because of our insurance. However we are now working with a group of Girl Scouts who come to our adoption events and hand out flyers and ask for donations at these events. We would be happy to have students help in this manner, of course they would need the permission of their parents. This weekend we had a garage sale and the Girl Scouts were very helpful us to set up.  They manned the front desk, telling the people about our work and asking for donations. We would love more help like this, but students would not be able to work directly with the dogs because of our insurance.
