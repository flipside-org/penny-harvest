mission: |
  K.I.D.S. is a global charity of leading retailers, manufacturers, and licensors of children’s and youth products, in partnership with major foundations, committed to helping improve the lives of children and their families who are ill, living in poverty, or are victims of natural disasters.

  

  K.I.D.S. pioneered a unique charity model more than 25 years ago that today aligns hundreds of companies with more than one thousand leading local agencies in the United States and Canada. 85% of our donations are distributed to agencies in the U.S. and the remaining 15% to countries abroad. This alliance donates children’s clothes, books, toys, and juvenile products… and brings hope… to children and their families at risk.
