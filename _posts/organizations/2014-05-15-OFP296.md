  The National Military Family Association offers programs for members of all seven Uniformed Services and their families.  We work hard to help families cope with the challenges of military life.  

  One of the biggest challenges military kids and families face is when the service member goes away to war.  Our Operation Purple program is a free week of summer camp for kids whose mom or dad is deployed. This special camp helps these kids cope with their stress and anxiety. We also offer Operation Purple Family Retreats to help families relax and reconnect after the service member returns from war.

  I have been with the National Military Family Association for two years.  Currently I work in the Development and Membership department, where I help raise money for our programs.  Before that, I helped run our Operation Purple Family Retreats for families who have been through the deployment of the service member.  I am married to a Navy officer and have two kids, ages 13 and 11.
