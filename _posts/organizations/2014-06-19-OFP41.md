  Have you ever looked into the frightened, hungry, eyes of a stray cat or dog and wondered what you can do? Bideawee needs kids like you to help us shelter, feed and give medical care to homeless animals. Your pennies will allow us to continue finding homes for over 1,000 animals each year.  Animals, like Jeena, the sweet cat found sealed up in a trash bag and thrown into a dumpster.  When Jeena was brought to Bideawee she had painful, oozing sores all over her body where someone had burned her. The medical staff gently treated her and eventually the fur grew back and Jeena repaid their kindness with cuddles and cat hugs. Jeena was adopted out to a wonderful family and she will never be tossed away again.   Miracles like this happen everyday at Bideawee.  If you want to be part of this dedicated team of animal lovers visit our website, www.bideawee.org for more stories and follow ups.
mission: |
  companion animal welfare society whose no-kill adoption centers have found loving homes for more than one million dogs, cats, puppies and kittens in the century since we were founded.

  

  Every year, thousands of helpless, unwanted pets find their way to Bide-A-Wee's doors to receive shelter, food, medical care, companionship and love. Within a few months, nearly all are successfully placed with carefully screened adopters.  Today, Bide-A-Wee also works to preserve and extend the special relationship between people and these most devoted of friends, through education, community outreach, free spaying and neutering for dogs and cats every summer, an externship program for veterinary students, pet therapy, pet memorial parks, and the Golden Years Retirement Home for older, unadoptable pets.

    Second Start Program - Bideawee rescues dogs and cats from overcrowded city shelters where many of those animals would be put to sleep.  At Bideawee we house these dogs and cats, provide loving care, medical treatment, and training, and help find them good homes.

    $500 would help us transfer 2 animals from city shelters, and provide care while they are awaiting their future forever home.

    Veterinary Medical Assistance Fund (VMAF) - Bideawee pays for special medical treatment for the dogs and cats at our Adoption Centers.  For example, an animal might need emergency surgery followed by a long period of aftercare.  This happens because we make a point of taking in animals that may be abused, seriously ill or born with physical deformities.  We do everything we can to make sure that the homeless dogs and cats in our care are healthy and ready for adoption!  $750 would cover special care for 1-2 animals

  Hi! Iâ€™m Deborah and I share my life with Mr. Wobbles, a beautiful, but naughty black cat I adopted from Bideawee.  Mr. Wobbles was a Second Start animal. He was skinny and sick when he first came to Bideawee from the city shelter in Brooklyn.  His whiskers were burned off and one of his eyes was scarred and infected from a blow to the head.  Now he is healthy, thanks to the medical staff at Bideawee, and he shows his affection every night by purring for me as I go to sleep.  My most favorite thing at Bideawee is working with kids.  I love to show them where we keep the animals and talk about the best ways to take care of a pet.  I especially love sending dogs to schools where they sit and  listen as children read books to them.
