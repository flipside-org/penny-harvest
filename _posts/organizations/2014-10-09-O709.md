mission: |
  Our goal at Laconia is to create an environment as close to "home" as possible, and to help make the transition from the community home to the nursing home a smooth one. We provide 24-hour health care by a dedicated staff which includes nurses, doctors, social workers, recreational leaders, occupational, physical, and speech therapists, nursing assistants, a medical director, and a complete dietary program which is supervised by our registered dietician.
