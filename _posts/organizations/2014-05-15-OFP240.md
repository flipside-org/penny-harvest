  Randall's Island Park Alliance (RIPA) exists to maintain and improve Randall's Island Park and provide programming for people of all ages. This beautiful multi-use park offers team sports, community events, volunteer projects, picnicking, education, exploration, and a whole bunch of healthy fun. In a nutshell, in Randall's Island Park, there are ball fields, wetlands, gardens, an urban farm, Icahn Stadium, a tennis center, a golf center, bike paths and walking paths, beautiful shoreline gardens, and many opportunities to appreciate a diversity of plants and animals with a diversity of great people.

    We have a wide range of programming in Randall's Island Park. Some things that we are hoping purchase the supplies to build when resources permit, are a 3 bin compost system for our urban farm, a rice thrashing basket (for harvesting rice), vegetable seeds to give to kids who come to our educational programming in the urban farm, and Rainwater harvesting systems to put at a few locations throughout Randall's Island Park to aid in the watering of the beautiful habitats.

    Costs of above items on our wish list:

    2"x10"x8" boards: 36 @ $7.82/each = $281.52

    8"x2 1/2" flat head wood screws (133/box):                                    2 boxes @ $7.98 = $15.96

    Variety of vegetable seeds: $25.00

    Rice thrashing basket: 1 @ $200.00/each = $200.00

    Rainwater harvesters: 3 @ $149.00/each = $447.00

    Combined total: $969.48

    

    We would appreciate any portion towards any of these things on our wish list.

    We would greatly appreciate the resources to create a printed map booklet, containing pictures and detailed descriptions of the diversity of areas and opportunities in Randall's Island Park. The cost of this is dependent on the number of pages and the quantity printed. If we received $1,000 towards this project, we would match the rest with funding from other sources (such as other donors).

    We offer a vast array of public educational and cultural events. We would greatly appreciate student performances to enhance our program and share your talents with the public in Randall's Island Park.

    As for volunteer events, we have a great need for volunteer support. We ask volunteers to be tree stewards, to pick up litter, to remove invasive plants that attempt to outgrow slower growing plants, and to plant native plants in a variety of habitats. It would be very beneficial to have eye catching weatherproof signs that will support these efforts for the educational benefits to the general public.

  My name is Donna Piluso. I am the Volunteer Coordinator of the Randall's Island Park Alliance. I coordinate volunteer projects with school groups, corporate groups, non-profits, & individuals. I love working for the benefit of people, plants, and animals. I enjoy contributing towards hands-on work for the restoration and health of the environment and the well being of people. I have been working in the field of Volunteer Coordination and Environmental Education for the past twelve years. I began working with the Randall's Island Park Alliance (RIPA) last May as part of our Natural Areas Crew. RIPA brought me into my current position this February.
