  USACF was created to help in the education of African children.

USACF supports the education of more than 70,000 children in Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and South Africa. In Zimbabwe more than half the children in our schools are orphans.

  My wife and I co-founded USACF after visiting schools in Africa and seeing that the schools had no books, no school supplies, no libraries and no sports equipment. Once home from Africa we found 35 schools in NY to become sister schools to schools in Africa. Before starting USACF I taught for 35 years in a Brooklyn High School.
