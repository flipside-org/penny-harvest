  The Greenpoint Lions Club has been serving the Greenpoint, Brooklyn, community for over 60 years. For the past eighteen years we have sponsored a fund raising event on the first or second Saturday of December. The proceeds from this event are earmarked for youth and their families- in-need for the holidays and throughout the year. During the past fifteen years, the Lions Club has been able to purchase toys and winter coats to be distributed during the Christmas season. The gifts are distributed through the St. Vincent De Paul society of St. Anthony's Church. Throughout the year the Lions are called upon to assist in the purchase of eyeglasses, coats and specific needs of youth and families under emergency situations. The number of youth served has grown over the years from about 100 to over 400 in 2004. The Lions motto is, "We serve", and we are hoping you will assist in our efforts.
