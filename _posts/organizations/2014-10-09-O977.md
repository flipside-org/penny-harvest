In addition to funding research, the PKD Foundation provides a forum for patients, family and friends through more than 70 volunteer-led  across the country and the world and holds the annual Walk for PKD  held each year on the third weekend in September, andand the National Convention on PKD the only conerence in the world for PKD patients and medical professionals.The PKD Foundation was established in 1982 by Joseph H. Bruening and Jared J. Grantham, MD, and is headquartered in Kansas City, MO.
