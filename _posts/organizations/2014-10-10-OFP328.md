  TheatreworksUSA is America’s largest professional (non-

  profit) theatre for kids and families.  Last year we brought 33 shows to 46 states and Canada, reaching  over two million kids!  In addition, Theatreworks distributed 35,000 FREE tickets to schools!  Some of our shows may be one of your favorite stories like "Junie B. Jones," "Bunnicula," "Charlotte's Web," or "Martha Speaks." Theatreworks also presents shows based on important historical events and people like Paul Revere, Harriet Tubman, and Rosa Parks.  For many kids, seeing a Theatreworks show may be the first time they have EVER been to the theatre.  We want to make sure that ALL kids, no matter where they live or what school they go to, can have a live theatre experience that is both educational and of course entertaining!

    Theatreworks makes sure that our ticket prices are very affordable. However, there are still some schools and families that cannot afford tickets.  With your support, we can provide FREE tickets to kids both in NYC and around the country. It only costs $8.75 per ticket in NYC, so every penny really helps!  A grant of $875 will send 100 kids to the theatre!

  Hi hard working students! Thank you for taking the time to raise money for organizations and causes that really need your help.  When I was a student like you, I also loved to volunteer and help organizations that I felt passionate about. That is why I now work for TheatreworksUSA! I always loved theatre, working with kids, and supporting important causes. My job at Theatreworks is a lot like what you are doing right now! I help raise money and awareness about Theatreworks.  Not only is it a very fun job, but I get to help kids around the country!  When I was younger, being exposed to theatre was more than a form of entertainment. It helped make me a more confident and independent person.  It also helped make it easier for me to speak in public and of course, theatre is a great way to make many friends!  In addition, theatre can make learning fun and bring stories and history to life in a way that is often unforgettable. 

  If you have more questions about Theatreworks or want to experience a Theatreworks show for yourself, please feel free to call, email, or write to us anytime!  We can't thank you enough for considering Theatreworks for your Penny Drive!
