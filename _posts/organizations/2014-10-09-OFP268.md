  Have you ever been hungry and unable to prepare some food to eat?  SNAP delivers hot lunches to homebound elderly who cannot prepare meals for themselves.  An older person who is crippled with arthritis cannot stand in front of the stove to cook a meal and would not safely be able to remain alone in the house.  SNAP delivers a delicious hot meal from a caring person, Monday - Friday and the senior is nourished, happy and safe in the home!

  My name is Marian Lewek and I have worked at SNAP for 25years.  I am the Chief Operating Officer and it is my job to make sure that our seniors receive all of the services that they are entitled to.  The best part of my job is talking with the seniors and learning about their lives and listening to stories about themselves and their families and friends.
