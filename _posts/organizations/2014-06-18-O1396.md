  Three Dot Dashâ„¢ is a global initiative of the We Are Family Foundationdesigned to recognize and support the efforts of Global Teen Leaders around the world who are actively working on projects that promote a more peaceful society by addressing issues related to basic human needs: food, water, health, shelter, safety and education. Inspired by the late 13-year-old poet and peacemaker Mattie J.T. Stepanek , Three Dot Dash is an innovative year-round leadership and mentoring program that teaches teen leaders how to "tell their stories" effectively using various forms of media, current technology and distribution methods in order to accelerate their leadership potential, advance their projects, mobilize peers and amplify their work to broader audiences around the world to action.
