  New York City is a great place to live and work! But it’s expensive, and sometimes families need help finding a great place to live, work, and raise children. Hope Community makes sure that families, the elderly, and former homeless individuals have a home in East Harlem. We have over 5,000 low-to middle-income residents living in our 80 buildings. We also help small businesses in the community grow by offering affordable ground floor commercial space in our buildings and by organizing fun events like Taste Trolleys that encourage people from all over the world to come to East Harlem to shop, play, and try new foods!

    We have a community garden that everyone in East Harlem loves to visit! We would love to have volunteers to help us plant flowers and take care of the garden in the spring and summer. This could be for a couple hours on a Saturday or after school.

    Hope Community hosts holiday events for our residents on Thanksgiving, Christmas and Mother's Day. Because many of our families don't have a lot of money, we help to collect toys, winter coats, or food to give to the people we serve. We could use your help in collecting items for our residents!

  Hi! I'm Julie. I've worked with Hope Community for one year and am so pleased to have received a gift from students at Hamilton Heights last year. 

  My job is to raise money for the organization by meeting new people and developing relationships with them so that they understand what Hope Community does and how they can help us continue our work in East Harlem. I look forward to meeting you and hope we will work together in the future!
