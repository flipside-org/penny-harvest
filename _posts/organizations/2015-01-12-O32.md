  The Greater Allen Cathedral of New York, founded in 1834, continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to God and to God's people. Pastor Floyd H. Flake and Co-Pastor M.Elaine Flake have led the congregation to unparalleled heights through obedience to God's vision, praise and worship, Christian education, basic education, economic empowerment and political and social action.

  God, through His servant, is transforming people into God's image, the church into a place of salvation, power, health and wholeness, and the community into a village; a good place to live because of people who care.
