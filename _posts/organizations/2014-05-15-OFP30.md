    CUDDLES Program

    

    This  program  focuses on the emotional support for children (Cuddles). In Cuddles, stuffed teddy bears or animals with personalized t-shirts are sent to infants and children who are either going through surgery, transplants, chemotherapy or dealing with stressful situations.  For example, these Cuddles bears have been used in a play therapy way to help children overcome the fear of eye examinations or surgery when parents and/or the doctor examine the bears eyes first or practices preparations for surgery with the bear.

    WE CARE program.  Teens and adults may also experience fear, need someone to talk to, or just feel good that people are thinking of them when going through surgery, transplants, chemotherapy or dealing with stessful situations. In the We Care program, when a person is referred, we send out an age appropriate appropriate “thinking of you” item.

  Aniridia Foundation International (AFI) is a 501(c) 3 non-profit charitable organization dedicated to assisting those with low vision or blindness.  Executive Director, Jill Nerby, founded AFI in 2001.  Originally called USA Aniridia Network, the name was changed in 2006 due to the rapid growth of international memberships.  Jill received her undergraduate degree in Psychology and Biology, and finished her pre-med studies while working in the field of occupational therapy.  Jill was born with Aniridia and glaucoma and has undergone numerous surgeries to preserve her vision.  Because of Jill’s experience with this condition, as well as her passion to help others, educate the public, and desire to make a difference for visually impaired and blind children of today and tomorrow, she invested her personal savings and time to launch this foundation.
