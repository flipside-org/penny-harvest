  Not everyone can walk to Central Park or can go see a river around here.  We are a visionary community based organization in the Mott Haven and Port Morris neighborhoods of the South, South Bronx.  We manage an exciting community garden that hosts numerous schools and groups and serves as an inspiration for many. We work to create public access to our waterfront where there are many power plants and garbage handling facilities.  We work to heal Nature Deficit Disorder and make sure that No Child is Left Inside!  We are working to stop Fresh Direct from p0olluting and taking over our waterfront without an environmental impact statement, see boycottfreshdirect.com for more!

  Hello, some say I am the person in charge, but really I try to help all our volunteers and students learn and enjoy nature, so I am the Lead Helper, not a "Director".  I do the paperwork and also do presentations at schools, go to meetings, wear a suit (only sometimes)  and advocate for a better environment. It is most fun to be in the gardens with my hands in the earth looking at a worm or a ladybug, or picking fresh lettuce or kale or mint!  Or even canoeing in New York City and seeing the fish.  We were lucky to work with a school and Comments Cents this year and look forward to more!
