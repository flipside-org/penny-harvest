description: 
mission: |
  Deborah Heart and Lung Center and Deborah Hospital Foundation may have two different names, but neither organization could fulfill its mission without the work and support of the other.  Based on their combined reputations, spanning nearly nine decades, the Center and Foundation have both achieved major successes which have been instrumental in making Deborah a widely-known and highly-respected name in the region.
