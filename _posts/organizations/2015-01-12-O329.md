description: 
mission: |
  The mission of the Cristian Rivera Foundation is to help find the cure for the Pontine Glioma brain stem tumor that ultimately claimed Cristian’s young life. The foundation has already contributed $140,000 to the research of Dr. Mark Souweidane, a neurosurgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Director of the Weill Cornell Pediatric Brain and Spine Center for his therapeutic approach to DIPG. Dr. Souweidane, inspired by his patient Cristian Rivera and other children and their families affected by devastating childhood cancers, will be launching a pioneering FDA-approved clinical trial. The innovative use of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) will be the first of its kind to administer radio immunotherapy to children with an otherwise incurable tumor.
