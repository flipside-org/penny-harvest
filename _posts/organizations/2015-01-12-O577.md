mission: |
  To address the problem in Meru Town, Kenya of homless, uneducated, abandoned children, Joseph Kirima Rwito, a 47 year old elementary school principal, Teachers Union leader and Education Secretary for the East Africa Pentecostal Churches, has built a shelter for the youngest street children. He has converted an empty church building into a combination dining hall and kitchen, and added a second structure that provide space for a dormitory, classrooms and staff quarters. These buildings will eventually house up to 80 street children, ages 6 to 13 years old.  We now have 41 boys and girls under our care. Two are in nursery school, and the rest attend elementary school. The Jerusha Mwiraria Hope Children's Home, located 5 km south of Meru town center on a 1 acre site belonging to the Hope Children's Fund, Ltd., provides for abandoned children from all denominations.
