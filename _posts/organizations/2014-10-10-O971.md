  The Holi Sammelan Festival is a major cultural event in New York City. For the Indo-Caribbean community, it has now become one of the biggest cultural activities of the year, where some 3,000 people participate and thousands more follow this program live on WICR radio 1620AM. Over 50 Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), including Mandirs are participating to celebrate one of Hinduismâ€™s most significant religious/cultural festivals, called Phagwah or Holi, that dates back to over 5,000 years. Phagwah marks the beginning of the Indian spring and ushers in a time of the sharing of goodwill and our bounty.
