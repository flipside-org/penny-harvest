mission: |
  The Peace Corps Partnership Program connects interested groups or individuals to the pressing needs in developing communities where Peace Corps Volunteers serve.

  Since its inception in 1964, the Partnership Program has helped thousands of Peace Corps Volunteers implement community-initiated projects which have had significant and positive impacts on communities and thousands of individuals. The Partnership Program does not directly fund projects, but serves as a link to groups, foundations, service organizations, and individuals wanting to contribute to the valuable work Volunteers do with their host communities. By establishing this link between Americans and communities overseas, the Partnership Program facilitates an understanding among different cultures and the opportunity for cross-cultural exchange.
