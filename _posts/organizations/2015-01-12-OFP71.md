  Council for Unity is a not-for-profit organization that started as an anti-gang coalition and later took on the mantle of a broader issue, violence.  The word gang has many different meanings and connotations to different people. A broad definition of the word gang is a group of people that, for a variety of different reasons, share a common identity. Youth tend to be attracted to gangs because of the need to belong. Whether we like to recognize it or not, gangs give our youth what they believe to be a family setting that they may be lacking, or feel they are lacking, in their home life for a variety of reasons. Everyday we strive to make students realize that a family which requires you to commit a violent act is no family at all. The Council for Unity seeks to provide youth with the ideal that they are striving for, a family. We offer curricula for students in elementary, junior high and high school. Our curriculum is our program. Curricula is the plural version of curriculum. The Council for Unity is an organization that is one of only a few dedicated to stopping violent activity. However, we rely on donations to subsist and we need your help to keep these programs alive.

    Student manuals go for about $20.00 each, so a grant of $500.00 would provide students in the program with 25 manuals.

    Student manuals go for about $20.00 each, so a grant of $500.00 would provide students in the program with 25 manuals.

    Our Induction Ceremony is held annually and includes meal, certificate and ceremony.  This is our end of year celebration and the cost is about $30.00 a student.  A $1,000 grant would help us send about 33 students to Induction.  Unfortunately, many students do have trouble paying and that is why this is necessary.

    

    Student events can be expensive.  In the past we did them frequently, and recently we have not been able to do many at all with our limited funds.  We would estimate that Leadership training events, college prep programs and college trips usually run about $75.00 a student.  These kinds of trips are beneficial to the student and they are something that has come to be expected of our program. A grant of $1000 would provide us with enough to send about 13 students on a trip that is beneficial for their future.

    

    Curriculum manuals, which are given to Site Coordinators and advisors as a tool for implementing the curriculum, go for about $30.00 each. A grant of $250.00 would give us about eight curriculum manuals.

    Our training course for new advisors and coordinators runs about $50.00 a person (the training course is three days long).  With a $500.00 grant we can train ten new advisors and/or site coordinators.

    Adopt a student:  $60.00

    A program where individuals and businesses are invited to make a difference in one student’s life.  For $60.00, you can provide a student with a manual and art supplies (also necessary in the program).  You will receive a thank you note as well as a student testimonial at the end of the year.

    A grant of $300.00 would provide 5 students with the necessary training to become inducted members of the Council for Unity.  Adopt a class (30 students): $1,800.00

    A similar program, however with an $1800 donation you can adopt an entire class.  This is equivalent to thirty $60.00 donations.

    Internships in our office would give a student the opportunity to get a feel for working in an office environment.  The student would be asked to do such tasks as data entry, copying, faxing, filing, answering the phones, as well as general paperwork.  They may be asked to help with fundraising activities or other events.

    Peer tutoring is an experience that we like to be able to give to our students who struggle with their workload.  As a peer tutor, the student would be expected to tutor another student in a particular subject area.

    Youth Congress would give the student an opportunity to engage in a student led organization, similar to student government.  The student would be invited to represent their school and come to Congress meetings, as well as participate in Congress events.

  Hi, my name is Jessica Szczepanik and I am a Site Coordinator with Council for Unity as part of their School Based Initiative. The reason that I became involved with this organization is that the more I see of the world, the more I find that violence is a growing problem. It’s hard to believe that our culture is so driven by violence, however if you look in the overview section of this profile you will find statistics from the Center for Disease Control pertaining to American youth and gun violence that are very real and very disturbing.
