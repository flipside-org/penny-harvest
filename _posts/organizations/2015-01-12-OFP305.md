    Weekend Meals: Citymeals contracts with local meal centers to prepare and deliver nutritious meals on Saturdays and Sundays, when government-funded meal programs are closed.  Each weekend meal contains one-third of the recommended daily allowance of nutrients for a senior for one day.  A typical weekend menu includes roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, cut green beans, milk, bread, butter and a piece of seasonal fruit.  Each meal costs $6.42 to prepare and distribute.  We are seeking a cash grant of $1,000, which would buy approximately 156 meals. Every penny helps and 100% of your donation goes directly to our program.

    Holiday Food Boxes: These boxes contain shelf-stable food items equivalent to three full meals, and are delivered ahead of long holiday weekends (such as Memorial Day, July 4th, Thanksgiving, etc.) when city-run neighborhood meal centers are closed.  Each box contains items such as vacuum packed pouches of tuna, canned vegetables, organic apple sauce, powdered milk, instant brown rice, decaffeinated coffee, tea bags, oatmeal cookies and wheat crackers.  Recipients are encouraged to keep some of the food on hand at all times so they can survive any unexpected disruption of their regular meal deliveries.  It costs us approximately $24 to package, stock and deliver each box.  We are requesting a cash grant of $1,000, which would provide for 42 holiday boxes.

  Hello,

  I am just starting my job at Citymeals-on-Wheels this week! I ask people for money to keep our programs running. I love the idea that young people are already thinking about what they can do to help others. Your help does change someones life and makes the world a little brighter.
