  When you think back to teachers you've liked, the class where you had the most fun, the summer when you went on the best trips, and the places you've been where you've learned something that you still can't believe then roll them all into one, you understand what we're trying to do at Addie Mae Collins.  Our organization delivers preschool services through a Head Start program from 2 locations in East Harlem.  The majority of the children who attend the Head Start are from families who are considered poor.  We use every dime we receive to take children places they may never have visited before, to help them learn things that people typically think they can't learn, and to help the families and friends of thosee children we serve who simply can't do everything alone.  We accomplish those goals mostly through the use of fun and inspiring activities designed to uplift, promote a lifelong love of learning, and which allow parents, young children, and siblings an opportunity to improve themselves, and our community.  Addie Mae Collins exists to inspire a love of learning in children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old;and, to help their families.  We try to create a friendly environment and classrooms that inspire a love of learning by creating memorable moments and opportunities you might not have had if we'd never met.

    We hold a Science Fair $600.00 to allow the children to explore how things work in a fun and imaginative way.  The children will take what they've learned and share it with event visitors can see how we use science everyday.  The funds will be used to order materials to build science displays, to buy awards and prizes for every child who participates and visits the events.  We also use the donations to purchase refreshments for the events.

    Cultural Day; $675.00. On cultural days the children dress up in the fashions of the cultures we're exploring, we eat those foods typically found in that culture and play the games the children of that culture play.  We get totally immersed and invite our families and our community to join in the fun. Children, parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and cousins will be invited to help our children explore a culture they know nothing about or think they know about in a totally awesome way. Stop by and see us dress the part, listen to the music, learn the traditional dances, play traditional games, learn about the climate, the money, the food and every other little thing our children may find interesting.  Funds will be used to purchase materials (culturally reflective clothes, music, food, etc.) for the cultural immersion of each of our centers (sites at 101st Street, 127th and the site at 129th Street).

  Hi!  I'm Diane,  I'm the Director of Addie Mae Collins Head Start.  I work with preschoolers because I still remember my first classroom and my first teacher.  I remember having fun, laughing and acting crazy with my friends at preschool.  I began working with Head Start children and their families because I believed I could help create experiences that would help them grow up enjoying school, to help them learn to love learning and, to encourage children to see every day as an opportunity to know something they didn't know the day before.  If someone could make school fun and learning interesting for you wouldn't you want them to work at your school, to work in your class?  We try to have loads of fun every day and laugh a lot because it keeps the children happy and interested in what comes next.  We need your donations and would appreciate any amount because it can all help us make magic for our preschoolers-You Have The Power!!!!

  I can't do it alone and neither can my staff.  We need support.
