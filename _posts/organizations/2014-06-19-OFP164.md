  Music Outreach brings creative approaches to learning for special needs children in Early Childhood classes in elementary schools across the City.  Our series of Music & Literacy Workshops creates a learning environment of wonder, imagination, and joy through instrumental demonstrations, songs and award-winning stories that are set to original musical accompaniment.  Children actively participate in musical games, listening exercises, singing, conducting and using percussive instruments.  The Workshops are presented by professional career musicians who are skilled in communicating with children and have a gift for bringing laughter to the learning process.  The Workshops tap into children's natural abilities and ensure that every child has a successful and positive learning experience.  Each workshop is approximately one hour long.

  Schools should be a welcoming place and music is one of the greatest pleasures of life and learning.  Music helps us express who we are and that is why from earliest history people have created music.  When our children attended elementary school there were no music enrichment classes and that is why in 1979 my husband and I began Music Outreach Programs.  I am Roslyn Gamiel, Director of Education Programs and am responsible for bringing the programs to the school.  I can be contacted at 212-316-2000 on business day afternoons.  Now, children in classrooms across the City can experience the beauty and power that music brings to their lives.  We have not worked with Common Cents schools in the past.
