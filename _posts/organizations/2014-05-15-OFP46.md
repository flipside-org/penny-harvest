  How would you feel if you were abandoned, homeless, and living on the streets with no food or water? That is the situation that thousands of animals face in our city. To make matters worse, they have no voice to ask for help. This is where Bobbi and the Strays comes in. We take the animals off the streets and find them loving homes.
mission: |
  Bobbi and the Strays believes that animals deserve our love, compassion, and respect. Our purpose is to undertake rescue operations and to provide essential care for orphaned, stray, abused and special needs cats and dogs. Through rehabilitation, socialization and adoption, we endeavor to provide a humane service to all animals that come into our care. Additionally we generate awareness about the prevention of animal abuse and neglect as well as spay/neuter programs and their important effect on the dog and cat overpopulation crisis. 

cash_grants: yes
grants: 
  - |
    Our spay and neuter program would greatly benefit from a grant - $500 would help spay over 500 animals preventing puppies and kittens from being born on the street.
  - |
    Funding to board an animal is greatly needed. When we take animals in off the street, they need a place to stay till we find them a forever home. $500 would provide boarding for 2 animals for one month $1000 would provide boarding to take in 4 animals off the street for one month
service_opp: yes
services:

    We can always use volunteers at both our locations to help take care of the animals.  A collection drive is always needed to keep saving more lives.

    Performances (as in a benefit party) would be great to collect funds to help us continue our most important work.

  Hi from Bobbi & the Strays!  We are a no-kill animal rescue whose mission is clear - we save homeless, abandoned and abused cats and dogs and keep them safe until we can find their forever home.  Hope you can help us as in the past to continue our most important work and save as many lives as possible.  Please help us to help those that cannot help themselves.  We are their voice =)
