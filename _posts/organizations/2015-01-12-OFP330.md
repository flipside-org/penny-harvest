  Tuesday's Children, a non-profit family service organization provides a wide range of programs for all people directly impacted by the tragedy of September 11, 2001.  Our mentoring program matches children who lost their parent on this tragic day with an adult role model in their community.  They spend time together twice a month, trying new activities, having fun and making memories.  Our newest program, Project Common Bond,  unites teens from around the world, who have experienced loss of a family member due to an act of terrorism, to learn peace building and conflict resolution.
