  I oversee landscape projects and environmental education programs with Park staff, the Urban Park Rangers and volunteers.  I also write grants and look for money for my projects.   

  Working with kids and volunteers on these projects are great!  Their energy and enthusiasm helps to make the projects alot of fun to do. I am always proad and impressed with the results of many working hands!  Some of the students from the round tables have come out and volunteered in the park.
