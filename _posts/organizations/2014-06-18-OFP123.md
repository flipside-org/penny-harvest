  The Holy Child Outreach Mission and Food Pantry

   Our mission follows in the footsteps of St. Vincent de Paul in being dedicated to assisting those in need and seeking charity and justice.  We strive to provide social outreach services to members of the community who are in need.  The mission provides various services such as food for the needy, social service information and referrals, transportation for the elderly, shelter placement and housing assistance information, and job exchange.  Through the financial support and food donations of the parishioners of the parish, this ministry provides outreach to ALL members of the community regardless of race, gender or religion.

  I have been a professional social worker for many years and when I retired, I was asked to volunteer to help grow my Church's Mission that helped those in the community going through difficult times.  Our group reaches out to anyone who needs our help and we try to help them with whatever difficulty they are having.  We provide non-perishable food items as a first step.  We also interview our clients and we try to help them along the way so that at some point they will be self-sufficient again.
