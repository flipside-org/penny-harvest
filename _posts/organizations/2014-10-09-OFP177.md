  The New York Foundling has been helping children and families for more than 140 years. We provide homes for almost 1400 children who are unable to be with their families. About 125 children are adopted through The New York Foundling every year.

mission: |
  Founded as a home for abandoned children, The New York Foundling has been saving children, preserving families and building communities since 1869. The agency helps children, youth and adults in need through advocacy and through preventive and in-care services that help each individual reach his or her potential. In the tradition of openness and compassion of its sponsors, the Sisters of Charity, the agency touches the lives of more than 13,000 people each year in the New York City area and in Puerto Rico as it upholds its guiding principle: Abandon No One.

    We are asking for support for our Crisis Nursery/Family Crisis Center.  This program helps families who, for a short time, are unable to care for their children by giving them a safe place to stay.  Every $150.00 provides for one day of care for a child to stay safe and cared for.

    We need $500.00 to provide a weeks stay at our sleep-away camp which The New York Foundling sponsors in upstate New York. Approximately 180 Foster children and children looking to be adopted by a loving family, between the ages of 8 & 14 will attend this summer.
