mission: |
  In partnership with Mount Sinai Children’s Community Health (MSCCH) and the New York City Department of Education, The Children’s Aid Society established a community school at P.S. 50 in 2000. A disproportionately large percentage of P.S. 50 students suffer from medical and emotional conditions inherent to living in a community marked by extreme poverty.
