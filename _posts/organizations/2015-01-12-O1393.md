mission: |
  Our mission is to help communities in need develop safe and sustainable water sources. By combining formal instruction with hands-on training we teach people how to supply and maintain their own local water resources. Our focus is not simply to provide safe drinking to those in need- our goal is to help people gain the knowledge and experience they need to help themselves and their communities.

  We currently operate with an all volunteer staff, many of whom raise their own support as well as the finances needed to complete their projects.
