mission: |
  HELP USA is a national not-for-profit organization with a mission to empower the homeless and others in need to become and remain self-reliant.  Through the development of quality housing with on-site support services, HELP USA provides resources for its residents to become independent and productive.  We break the cycle of dependency by addressing underlying causes in a way that respects the dignity of those we serve. We help our clients help themselves.
