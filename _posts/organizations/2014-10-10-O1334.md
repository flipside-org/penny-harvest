mission: |
  Tong-Len USA based in Greenville, North Carolina, is a charitable non-profit organization dedicated to funding programs that serve the poor in northern India. We are allied with Tong-Len Charitable Trust, based in Dharamsala, India, the non-governmental organization that implements the programs we fund. Our other partner organization, Tong-Len UK, is a major fundraiser based in Scotland. All three partner organizations strive to help displaced communities in northern India achieve a secure and sustainable future by addressing the root causes of their poverty and ill-health through a range of educational and health-based projects.
