  Autism Ambassadors was founded by 14-year old Zak Kukoff, a student from the tri-state area.  Autism Ambassadors uses a series of lessons, created by Zak and his team, to create real, lasting, friendships between kids with Autism and typical kids.  While these friendships are being built, the kids with Autism learn social, emotional, and academic skills from the typical kids, who are trained in the Autism Ambassadors lessons.
mission: |
  To lower the barriers that prevent children with Autism from participating in the school system as fully-functioning students. Autism is a pervasive condition that affects millions of children in the United States and abroad.  This year, 1 out of every 64 children will be diagnosed with one of the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), according to researchers at the University of Cambridge. These children will go through life stigmatized and rejected unless our system drastically changes.  Autism Ambassadors aims to help children on the Autism Spectrum feel socially connected and integrated in their academic environment.

  Hi!

  

  I'm Zak, and I founded Autism Ambassadors 1 year ago, when I was 13.  Autism Ambassadors not only was founded by kids, but is currently run by kids as well.  I haven't really worked with Common Cents, (besides a meeting I had with them) but I'm super excited to start.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.  Like most of you guys, I'm still at school (incoming 9th grader, if you're interested), so I'll try to respond to questions/comments after school every day or so.
