  We're proud of what we've accomplished since our founding in 1951:

  We've protected more than 119 million acres of land and 5,000 miles of rivers worldwide — and we operate more than 100 marine conservation projects globally. We have more than 1 million members <http://support.nature.org/site/PageServer?pagename=howyoucanhelp_mbr>. We work in all 50 states <http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/> and more than 30 countries <http://www.nature.org/wherewework/> — protecting habitats from grasslands to coral reefs <http://www.nature.org/joinanddonate/rescuereef/>, from Australia <http://www.nature.org/wherewework/asiapacific/australia/> to Alaska <http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/alaska/> to Zambia <http://www.nature.org/wherewework/africa/>.
