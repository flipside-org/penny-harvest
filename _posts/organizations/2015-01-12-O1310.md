mission: |
  Established in 1970, The Peregrine Fund works nationally and internationally, to conserve birds of prey in nature. We conserve nature by achieving results--results restoring species in jeopardy, conserving habitat, educating students, training conservationists, providing factual information to the public, and by accomplishing good science. We succeed through cooperation and hard-work, using common sense, being hands-on and non-political, and by emphasizing solutions. We are also cost effective--95% of all donations go directly to programs. The Peregrine Fund Board of Directors adopted a payout policy for earnings from our endowment which funds our administrative expenses.
