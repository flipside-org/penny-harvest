  Angelwish is an organization that helps sick children in need. We do this by buying holiday and birthday presents for them. We love getting help from young students to help pick out the best gifts!
mission: |
  Angelwish.org was created in 1999 with the mission to provide the public with an easy way to grant wishes to the millions of children that are living with HIV/AIDS around the world. Infected or affected by the disease, their opportunities for a "normal" childhood are virtually impossible.By harnessing the power of the Internet, Angelwish helps donors add a ray of hope to their lives. 

In 2010, after 10 years of focusing on HIV/AIDS, Angelwish expanded its mission to include children living with chronic illnesses such as asthma, diabetes and kidney disease. 

Angelwish achieves its mission by ensuring that 100% of individual donations are used for program services and that those funds are extended, where possible, to incorporate an educational component giving young people a hands on lesson in philanthropy.

    Through our online giving program, students will be able to use the money they raised to purchase gifts for children with chronic illnesses. All they have to do is visit our website and choose a care center (or multiple care centers) to support. We work with a nationwide network of social workers to make sure the gifts listed fit the needs of their population. 

    Each gift usually costs between $20-$30. Any size grant can fit this program.

    Students who raise $500 or more have the opportunity to go on an Angelwish Giving Spree. They will be invited to a local toy store or bookstore to use the money they raised to purchase gifts for ill children in need. The gifts will then be sent to social workers at our partner care centers, and they will distribute the gifts to parents to give to their children. 

    We encourage our participants to choose gifts that are between $20-$30.

  Hi everyone! My name is Carolyn and I have been working for Angelwish for almost a year. At Angelwish, I plan fundraising events and talk to people at different companies, foundations, and schools to raise money for the children we support. I am very excited to work with a Common Cents school and to see what presents you pick out for other kids in need.
