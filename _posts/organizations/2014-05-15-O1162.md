mission: |
  The Somaly Mam Foundation is a nonprofit committed to ending modern day slavery in North America and around the world. Human trafficking, a mult-billion dollar industry, is the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world. With over two million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year, it is a global crisis that must be stopped. More resources are critically needed to support the rescue and rehabilitation of these young victims.

  

  Our vision: A world where women and children are safe from slavery.
