  Hi. I'm Coco, which is my nickname (my full name is Courtney). I love working for Global Kids because I am always inspired by our young people. Even students who don't think of themselves as leaders develop and grow into amazing leaders with us and global citizens. I have worked with Global Kids for 10 years!! That's a long time!! One of my favorite experiences: traveling with Global Kids youth on Peace Boat, where we visited over 10 countries!
