mission: |
  Congregation Ohab Zedek of Belle Harbor was severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy. We have completed our first phase of cleaning out the Shul and distributing emergency funds to families in need. 

  The majestic Shul building had its entire bottom floor, Beis Medrash, and social hall space destroyed by flood waters. The damages are estimated to cost over one million dollars. This is in addition to the many families from the Shul that are struggling with the terrible financial burden of their own property damage.
