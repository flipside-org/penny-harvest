  Ryan’s Well Foundation has two goals – BUILD and EMPOWER

  1.	Build water, sanitation and hygiene education projects.  Our focus is on isolated communities of East and West Africa and Haiti.  To date, we have completed over 700 wells in 16 countries – always in partnership with the local community to ensure sustainability – bringing access to clean water and sanitation to over 736,000 people.

  2.	Empower others to make a difference.  Ryan’s story is compelling – not only within the context of the global water and sanitation crisis – but also as motivation for all of us to take action.  Now an undergraduate student, Ryan continues to inspire people of all ages – youth in particular – to make a positive change in the world.

  My story is really very simple. One day in January 1998, I was sitting in my Grade One classroom.  My teacher, Mrs. Prest, explained that people were sick and some were even dying because they didn’t have clean water. She told us that some people walked for hours in Africa and sometimes it was just to get dirty water.

  All I had to do was take 10 steps from my classroom to get to the drinking fountain and I had clean water. Before that day in school, I figured everyone lived like me. When I found out this wasn't the case, I decided I had to do something about it. So, I went home and begged my mom and dad to help. After a few days, they told me I could do extra chores to earn the $70 I thought would build a well. I thought that's all it would take to solve the world's water problem. I worked for four months to earn my first $70. Then I learned that it was actually going to cost $2,000 to build a well in a place like Uganda. I also learned that the problem was way bigger than I realized.

  I started speaking to service clubs, school classes, to anyone who would listen to my story so that I could raise money for my first well at Angolo Primary School in Uganda. That’s how my little Grade One project became the Ryan’s Well Foundation.

  I am now a third year student at the University of King’s College in Halifax on the east coast of Canada. I am studying international development and political science but remain involved with the Foundation as a speaker and Board member. My advice to anyone is that in order to make a positive change in the world, you need to find something you are passionate about and then you need to take steps to act. For me, the issue is water and sanitation. Water is essential to all life. I hope my story is a reminder that we can all make a difference - it applies to each and every one of us.
