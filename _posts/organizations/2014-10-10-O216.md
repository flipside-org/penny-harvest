mission: |
  At Weill Cornell's Cancer Center, the mission is clear: prevention. World-class researchers are collaborating to find ways to stop cancer before it ever has the chance to gain a foothold. Despite significant progress made to date, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States. In 2009, there were nearly 13 million new cases of cancer diagnosed worldwide.
