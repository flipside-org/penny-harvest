  Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) has been providing women, families and youth with vital health services and education since we first opened our doors 90 years ago. We strive to ensure that all individuals have access to important health services, like sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV screenings, pregnancy tests, birth control consultations, and pap smears, regardless of their income level. 

  PPNYC offers free and reduced services based on economic status and helps many patients fill out paperwork for public programs to cover the cost of their services. We also reach thousands of young people every year through PPNYC’s sexual and reproductive health education programs, which take place in schools, our health centers, and at community based organizations throughout the city.

    Did you know that teen pregnancy rates have increased in recent years?  Not only that, but more teens are being diagnosed with STIs like Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis.  Young adults also represent over half of all new HIV cases. 

    These statistics are incredibly scary and make it clear that something needs to be done! PPNYC provides essential health services, including STI screening and treatment, and also has many sex education programs for young people. 

    We depend on public support, from people of ALL ages, to keep our programs going. PPNYC wants to ensure that all people have the ability to make informed decisions related to relationships, pregnancy and sexual health. That is where you come in... With your help we can provide critical services to people in NYC.

    

    - A $150 grant will fund contraceptive counseling and birth control supplies for one teen for an entire year.

    

    - A gift of $275 will provide a low income client with a comprehensive gynecological exam and contraceptive counseling.

    Planned Parenthood of New York City has programs for teens to become empowered and in control of their lives!  We offer trainings for both young people and educators in order to provide teens with the information and skills they need to make healthy decisions about sex and reproduction.

     PPNYC is widely viewed as the leading provider of sexual education within New York City. Our Teen Advocate Program benefits thousands of teens by promoting responsible and educated decision-making.  We train young people to serve as educators for their friends because we feel that teens are each other’s best teachers.  The Advocates share key information with other young people about sexual health and behaviors through interactive performances. Last year alone, our Advocates reached approximately 2,200 young people in more than 20 locations! 

    - A grant of $1,000 will support a series of peer education sessions for at-risk youth.

    Students who are interested in supporting PPNYC’s work can do so in a variety of ways. You could set up an information table in your cafeteria and distribute information from our website and materials provided by PPNYC, to talk with other students about sexual health. You could also talk to your teacher or after school program staff about arranging for the Teen Advocates to visit your after school program, where they will discuss a variety of sexual health topics -- including abstinence, peer pressure, relationships, and prevention of pregnancy and STIs.

    

    Students can also volunteer directly with PPNYC staff to support the people that we serve. A volunteer experience will allow students to see firsthand the work that we do in the community, interact with staff members, and learn about sexual and reproductive health.

    

    Some possible volunteer opportunities include:

    1. Working with the Education Department to help get materials ready for a community sexual health workshop. You will learn about our presentations and see what information our educators present about, providing you with the opportunity to learn more about reproductive health. You will also get to talk with PPNYC staff about the work that they do and why they are involved. Through this experience, student volunteers will learn about how PPNYC is reaching students and adults across New York City with accurate information about health and relationships.

    2. Students can help the Clinical Services Department prepare for a staff training. These trainings are for many different staff members, including: nursing and administrative staff and medical students. By volunteering with the clinical services team, you will learn about the roles of nurses and staff members and also about the many PPNYC programs and projects taking place in the community and at our 3 health centers.

  Hello, my name is Paige and I work with the fundraising team at Planned Parenthood of New York City. I have been working for Planned Parenthood for three years and have seen firsthand what amazing services the organization provides to all people, young and old, of all backgrounds and income levels. At my previous job with a Planned Parenthood in Washington State, I worked as a community educator and spoke with countless young people about reproductive health – I am continually inspired by students’ desire to learn and reach out to others. 

  I have been passionate about reproductive health issues since I was a high school student. I come from an area with high rates of teen pregnancy and STIs and feel that every person, including teens, should have the information and resources needed to make educated decisions about their sexual health.  I am lucky to work for an organization that feels the same and provides reproductive health services and education to thousands of New Yorkers. I am proud to work for PPNYC and am excited to work with Common Cents and students in New York City.
