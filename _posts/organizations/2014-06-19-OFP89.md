  How would you feel if you came to a new country, didn't speak the language, couldn't help your children with their homework, and couldn't find a job? The Family Support Center offers a variety of services for people like this, including: classes and job training for adults, therapy for children, education for families about how to stay healthy, and reading classes, leadership, and volunteer opportunities for kids. The people we serve live in southwest Brooklyn.  Most are new immigrants, and come from many different countries.

  

  Right now, we are working on a new project to help children and families.  It's called the Sunset Park Promise Neighborhood.  Our goal is to make sure that all children in the community are healthy and safe and have the tools they need to do well in school and succeed in life.  We are working with about two dozen organizations in Sunset Park as part of the Promise Neighborhood and we are all committed to making families stronger and helping our community.  You can help us reach this goal with your grant to us!

    The work for this project is done through a group of action teams made up of staff from local organizations and residents from the neighborhood.  We are committed to having active community participation in the work of the project.  Many of our community members do not have strong English skills, so we hire interpreters for each meeting.  Interpreters cost $60 for a 2-hour meeting and $75 for a 2.5-hour meeting.  A grant of $450 would enable us to have interpretation for 5 of our 2-hour meetings and 2 of our 2.5-hour meetings, ensuring full and equitable participation for community members.

    We are running our program with almost no funding at this time, so even very small things are quite valuable to us.  For example, we often need basic office supplies such as copier paper and markers and chart paper for our meetings.  A grant of $250 would purchase supplies for 3 months, enabling us to keep the projet work moving ahead as we apply for full project funding.

  Hi! I've been working at the Family Support Center for 9 years. I used to run our adult education and training program where I worked with adults who were learning English, studying for the GED, or getting job training.  Now I am the director of the Sunset Park Promise Neighborhood, a new project that focuses on strengthening families, supporting children and building a healthier community.
