mission: |
  Main Line Animal Rescue specializes in the rescue and placement of abused, unwanted and abandoned companion animals. We never discriminate on the basis of health, age or breed. By involving and educating the community, Main Line Animal Rescue works to raise the public's awareness of the plight of homeless animals as well as realizing the benefits of adopting an animal in need. Our animals are examined, vaccinated, spayed or neutered and receive any and all medical treatment before they are placed in carefully screened homes.
