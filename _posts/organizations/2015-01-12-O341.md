mission: |
  The Dan Marino Foundation was established by Dan and Claire Marino in 1992. TheFoundation’s mission is to “open doors” towards independence for the Autism community, children with special needs, teenagers transitioning from fostercare and young adults with disabilities. The Foundation fulfills this mission by supporting comprehensive integrated treatment programs, providing outreach services, advancing scientific research, and building independence through employment and daily living transition programs. The Foundation has raised over $31 million since its inception, which has been used to fund major medical research, build the Miami Children’s Hospital Dan Marino Center, and operate life-changing programs.
