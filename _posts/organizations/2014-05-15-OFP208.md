  PEP for Seniors is an organization that helps keep seniors in the Bronx healthy and active in the community. We have Social Workers and a Nurse on our staff, and their goal is to keep the seniors as independent as possible so they won't have to go to a nursing home. We provide fun classes that keep seniors active and young at heart, like art, salsa, hip hop dance, yoga, and even belly dancing!
mission: |
  PEP for Seniors is a cooperative effort led by Beth Abraham, with the Parkchester Preservation Co., Parkchester Preservation Management, Bronx Jewish Community Council and Jewish Association for the Aged. The Parkchester Enhancement Program (PEP) is a Naturally Occuring Retirement Community (NORC) consortium that allows Parkchester seniors to remain living in the community by providing a variety of medical and social services.

    Classes like art, belly dancing, and yoga are expensive. Each month, we offer all 3 classes every week. Each month, Art class costs $240, Yoga costs $160, and Belly Dancing costs $160. This is the cost that we pay for the instructors. We do not want to charge our seniors for these classes, but in the last few years we have started charging them a very small amount ($3 per class).

    We would love to be able to help seniors learn to use technology like cell phones, tablets and cameras. We need students to help us teach seniors.

    We would love some help with our community garden. Seniors cannot do all of the heavy lifting, bending, and other activity needed for gardening. If a group of volunteers could help them, the seniors would be happy to teach the volunteers about gardening.

  Hi, I'm Nicole. I'm the Director of PEP for Seniors. I'm inspired by the story of how the Penny Harvest began and I would welcome the opportunity to help my seniors by using Penny Harvest funds. My job is to help elderly people stay healthy and independent in their own homes, so they don't have to go to a nursing home. If we receive help from Common Cents, we could provide more fun activities and classes for our seniors to stay happy and healthy!
