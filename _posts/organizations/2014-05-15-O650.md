description: 
mission: |
  The mission of our outreach  is two-fold. The first part is to be committed to our faith tradition and teachings as a Christian community and church that calls us to our greatest practices of love, hospitality, and justice, in welcoming the stranger among us. We are called to feed those who are hungry, clothe those who are poor, and see all as sisters and brothers.

  

  The second dimension of our mission reflects the first, without any requirement of our guests: it is to provide a genuine welcome, followed by the services we offer, among them: access to our food pantry, clothing center, dinner meals, office equipment, and general assessment services for referrals, including support for shelter, employment, medical care, and other needs to assist our guests in moving forward in their lives.
