  Do you want to help kids with blood cancers, like leukemia, get better and back to school? Donate a portion of your Penny Harvest grant to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS)! 

  LLS raises money to find cures for blood cancers and to provide services for patients and their families. Blood cancers include leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and Hodgkin's Disease. In the United States, more than 12,000 children under the

  age of 21 are diagnosed with cancer every year;

  approximately 3,000 of them will not survive the disease.

  Leukemias are the most common cancers in

  children younger than 18, and they cause more deaths

  than any other cancer among children and young adults

  under 20. Last year, about 497 children under 15 were

  expected to die from leukemia. 

  LLS raises money to help researchers find better treatments and cures for blood cancer. We know that the research LLS has funded has paid off, because the survival rate for childhood leukemia was just 3% in the 1950s, and now it's 90%! We will continue working hard until 100% of kids diagnosed with a blood cancer survive.

  

  LLS also helps people with blood cancer by providing them with lots of support during and after their cancer treatment. We give our patients financial aid to help them pay for medical costs and provide them with information about their cancer.  LLS also conducts support groups to help patients with their fears and concerns. 

  LLS supports kids with blood cancer in particular through The Trish Greene Back to School Program for

  Children with Cancer. This program teaches parents and teachers how to help kids get back into the swing of school after they have had cancer treatment. This can be a very difficult time for a child, since sometimes kids lose all of their hair and miss a lot of school during their cancer treatment. LLS tries to make it as easy as possible for a kid to come back to school by making sure parents and teachers know how to help them.

    The materials for the Trish Greene Back to School Program for Children With Cancer include "Cancervive Parent & Teacher's Guide," and an educational Charlie Brown video for students to learn about the emotional aspects of returning to school after treatment.  Each packet costs $10.  A grant of $1,000 would allow us to provide 100 schools with the materials to help kids with cancer make an easier transition back to school.

  Hi, my name is Jennifer and I am the manager of the Pennies for Patients program at the New York City Chapter of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  Pennies for Patients is an LLS penny drive for grades K-12 that takes place each fall or spring in schools across the country. This year we have more than 500 schools in New York City signed up to donate their spare change for blood cancer research and patient services!

  

  Part of my job is to conduct in-school assemblies and work with Pennies for Patients school coordinators to make sure the program is going well at their school.  

  I love my job because I get to meet new people and learn how generous people can be, especially students!
