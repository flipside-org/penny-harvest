mission: |
  Operation Exodus-Inner City was founded in 1988 in response to the desperate needs of children in Upper Manhattan. Located in Washington Heights, sixty children from kindergarten through high school participate in an after school tutoring program and Saturday mentoring program run by volunteers. The children are generally behind in their education and are beginning to display the negative effects of peer pressure in their lives.  Volunteers assist with programming, mentoring, and special events for students and their families.
