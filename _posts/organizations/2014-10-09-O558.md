mission: |
  Founded in 1975, our agency has grown from one small school into a large network of programs serving a wide range of New Yorkers who face significant challenges. Through a wide range of educational services, residential and family support programs, we enable these adults and children to achieve their full potential â€” while also transforming their lives.
