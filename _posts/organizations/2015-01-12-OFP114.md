  Integrated multicultural schools are teaching Arab and Jewish students how to create a more peaceful future. In Israel, Jewish and Arab children grow up with war, fear, and hatred of the other.  There is little opportunity to meet each other, because they mostly attend separate schools, live in different villages and only play with kids they know.  Of the 6 million Israeli citizens, 20% are Arabs and 80% are Jews.

  

  In the Hand in Hand public schools, Arab and Jewish children learn each other’s language and about each other’s culture and heritage.  This next generation will be prepared to create a more peaceful future in Israel and elsewhere.

  One Thousand students, from Preschool through High School, are now enrolled in four bilingual and multicultural Hand in Hand schools.  The schools are also making an impact in many communities, among local and international leaders and demonstrating that Jews and Arabs are creating a more peaceful future together.  

  These award-winning schools are teaching students mutual understanding as well as pride in their own heritage.  The students are taught to respect different opinions and perspectives as well as the common humanity that we share.

    A book costs $10-$20 and a contribution of $500 will help fill a schools classroom or library with wonderful age-appropriate books for our students.  This enables the schools to buy books in all three languages that are spoken and taught at the school - Hebrew, Arabic and English.  Books help students learn about the world, about each other and broadens their horizons

    It costs about $25 per student to offer special classes and a donation of $250 will support special programs in Civics Education, Conflict Resolution and Leadership Development for middle and high school students.

  I represent a most hopeful project, where students are leading the way and creating a more peaceful future.  Since my children have been involved with Common Cents at their school, I know about the important projects they have supported. I thought students and families would be inspired to learn about the students at the Hand in Hand Schools.
