  Family-to-Family works with kids all over the USA helping them be givers and doers!!

   We know that by being a kid, you have ideas and feelings that are unique to you. Sometimes the adults around you don’t quite see what you see.

  

  Like… when you see someone suffering, you might want to offer your help, or when you hear about a natural disaster you wish there was something you could do. Here at Family-to-Family, we’ve come up with a number of different ways to help you help moms, dad and kids in need, right here in the U.S.

    Books and backpacks for our GivingWorks program: $2.00 per child (200 children to participate $400.)

    

    GivingWorks gives kids living in poverty a chance to be a "givers" too, by providing books and backpacks for pre-

    school kids. The older kids read the books to the little ones and  then surprises them by telling them that the books are theirs to take home!

    Help families living in homeless shelters by providing funds for F-to-F to make Stuffed Shirts!  Stuffed Shirts are tee shirts we use to wrap up personal care items like soap, toothpaste, shampoo, toothbrushes, deodorant. We  tie the shirt up with a ribbon and the shirt is given to a mom/dad/kid when they come into a shelter. A clean shirt and these kind of personal care items means a lot when you have next to nothing.

    $10 per shirt. We'd like to make as many as we can!

    GivingWorks! Help kids everywhere be givers!

    

    We supply books and backpacks for middle school kids to give to pre-k kids in need.

    We ask you to do a book drive collecting gently used books for 3-6 year olds. Then, collect new or used backpacks, put 4 books in each bag and email F-to-F for a link to a local pre-k to bring the books to! We match you to a little one and then it;s time to read! The surprise comes at the end...when you write the name of the child you've read to in each of his/her 4 books and you tell them the books are theirs to take home!
