  Established in 1997 as a U.S. 501 (c) (3) public charity, Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (USA) exists to provide financial, in-kind and administrative back-up support for the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and other wildlife conservation oriented entities in Kenya. Wildlife and environmental diversity are essential if human populations are to thrive, and the dynamic partnership between Lewa (USA) and its conservation partners in Kenya provides the means to address the complex issues of sustainable wildlife conservation, educational programming, and community development.
