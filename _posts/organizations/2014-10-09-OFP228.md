  Publicolor works with children from New York City schools to change their boring, dreary school building into a fun, energetic learning environment.  Through an after-school program called Paint Club, students are taught how to paint and then work daily to add bright colors to the walls of their schools.  As students continue to participate, they have the chance to take part in other Publicolor programs, which offer tutoring, career classes, college guidance, and even paid painting jobs!

    A cash grant would be directly funding the purchase of supplies to paint the walls of a school.  It would buy the paintbrushes used by students and volunteers.

    

    Costs:

    201 2-inch Trimming and Edging Paint Brushes @ $4.97 each = $998.97

    Students could help to paint the walls of the school that they fund.  This could be a Saturday afternoon volunteer experience in which students work to change a school in need.  If students would like to paint their own school, have your teacher or principal contact Publicolor at 212-213-6121.

  Hi!  My name is Dave, and after working for four years at Publicolor, I’ve been able to do many fun and interesting things.  I started by working at Publicolor schools to lead our students in their transformation projects.  Now, I help to organize fundraising events and to find people to support Publicolor so that we can keep giving our students paintbrushes and paint to work with.  I’ve never worked with a Common Cents school in the past, but I am really excited by the opportunity!
