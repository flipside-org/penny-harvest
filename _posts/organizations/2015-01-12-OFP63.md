  Our mission is bringing the joy of music, the magic of wishes, the power of information, and compassion to seriously ill children and their families.  We provide Kids' Cancer Pages national resource guides to children, families, and medical professionals all over the country.  We also provide direct services to seriously ill children and families in Oregon and Southwest Washington -- the Chemo Pal program provides adult mentors for children undergoing treatment, the DreamCatcher program grants wishes and provides family support, the Music Rx program provides music therapy, and we offer weekend retreats to families free of charge at our Caring Cabin on the Oregon coast.
mission: |
  We’re here to help. The Children’s Cancer Association (CCA) is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization that was established in loving memory of five-year-old Alexandra Ellis </about_cca/about_alex.html> who courageously fought cancer for two and half years before she died on May 7, 1995. In the year of Alexandra’s death, CCA was born. Since then, CCA has worked to offer award-winning programs </resources_and_programs/>, along with information, advocacy and support that help enrich the quality of life for seriously ill children and their families.

  Hello.  Thank you for considering the Children's Cancer Association.  I have worked with CCA for over five years, and my job is to help raise money to pay for our programs that brighten the lives of seriously ill children and their families.  We were thrilled to receive our first grant through the Common Cents program.
