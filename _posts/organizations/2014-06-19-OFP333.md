  Ubuntu Education Fund works in the townships of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. The children and families we work with have been devastated by the AIDS epidemic, poverty, and an unfair legal system called Apartheid, which denied them their basic rights, such as access to education and health care.  We provide vulnerable and orphaned children with comprehensive educational resources and life-saving health services. Specifically, we provide our children with academic resources, such as libraries and computers, free medical care, holiday camps, after school programs, support groups, career guidance, scholarships to go to university, and job opportunities. We also offer HIV/AIDS testing, treatment, and support.

    Nandipa Mpondo is one example of the children Ubuntu helps. Now fifteen, Nandipa was abandoned by her parents when she was a baby. Two years ago, she learned that she was HIV-positive and her teacher enrolled her in Ubuntu’s Care and Support program.  At Ubuntu, Nandipa met Sis Dumsi, a counselor who encouraged her and taught her how to use her medication to stay healthy. Nandipa also joined an Ubuntu support group run by one of her classmates and recognized that being HIV-positive did not mean she could not live a full and happy life. She has become a community leader, helping her friends who are also HIV-

    positive to cope with the emotional battles and stigma of the disease. Today, Nandipa knows she is a strong person with a bright future, “I feel powerful and know that I can help myself and someone else.”

  I'm from the same communities in South Africa, Port Elizabeth where Ubuntu works. I know first-hand what it's like to go to school with no resources(books etc) and the devasting impact that HIV/AIDS and poverty are having in my community. I have lost many friends and family members from HIV/AIDS and want to make sure that the same thing does not happen to children growing up in Port Elizabeth today.
