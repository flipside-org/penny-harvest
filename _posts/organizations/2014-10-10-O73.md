description: 
mission: |
  Three out of every four shelter dogs are mixed-breed, and for many Mutt-i-grees, their lives end before they begin: No hope, no help, no voice. The American Mutt-i-grees Club was established to help join together mixed-breed dog owners - a group over 25 million strong - to incite change, and help these extraordinary dogs receive the hope, help, voice and loving homes they all deserve.
