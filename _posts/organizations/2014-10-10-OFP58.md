  Charley is a fun-loving, vibrant 10-year old boy who loves to play basketball, baseball and joke around with his brother Sammy, sister Maisy and his yellow lab Stella.  At 3 1/2 years old, Charley was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a fatal muscle wasting disease that affects only children.     Here are a few facts:

  

  •  DMD is the most common fatal genetic disease to affect children around the world.

  

  •  DMD affects one in every 3,500 boys.

  

  •  Children with DMD are confined to wheelchairs by adolescence and die before they reach adulthood.

  

  •  There currently is no treatment or cure for DMD.

  

  •  DMD is 100% fatal.

  

  Charley's Fund is racing the clock to find a treatment and cure for this cruel disease.  Thanks to Charley's Fund and the research it is funding, for the first time, THERE IS HOPE!  

  With your help, Charley and the 60,000 other boys just like him may live into adulthood and have families of their own.

  

  We at Charley's Fund would be ever so grateful if you would select us as your Penny Harvest/Common Cents recipient.  We would direct that money right into the hands of researchers who have the best shot at developing a treatment or cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

  

  - With many thanks from Charley and all the other DMD boys.
