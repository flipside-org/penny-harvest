  "There are NO LIMITS to what children can do....when given the opportunity." The No Limits Theater Group is a non-profit educational theater company that helps young deaf and hard of hearing children learn to speak for themselves.  The mission of No Limits is to provide a program that will help enhance a deaf child's self-esteem and confidence through the theatrical process and individual speech therapy.  No Limits is dedicated to teaching people all over the tri-

  state area about the talents of all deaf and hard of hearing children.   Deaf children who learn how to speak have to work extra hard and have to practice a great deal of dedication and commitment.   No Limits was voted "Best Arts Program in the Country" by Parents Magazine and was featured on OPRAH as a positive and uplifitng program for children.  Each year, No Limits produces original plays featuring deaf children from the NY and NJ area.  These theatrical workshops and professional stage productions allow deaf children to expand their vocabulary, improve their speech, cultivate creativity, engage in social situations with greater ease, and develop public speaking skills.  No Limits has recently expanded their Educational Outreach Program in which our inspirational and original production of "It Begins with a Dream" travels around to elementary schools in the area so that elementary school children can see our young actors perform and to hear their personal story of what it is like to live with a hearing loss.  Our goal is to bring this show to as many schools in the tri-state area as possible.

    Since we are a non-profit organization there are times when we need props or set pieces made.  We are a childrens theater group so fun and whimsical props are often needed for productions.   We often ask Art classes to help us with our needs.
