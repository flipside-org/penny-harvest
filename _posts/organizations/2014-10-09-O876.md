mission: |
  Serving 3,600 households a month, 20 percent more than last year. In fact, we are seeing many more faces of hungry families from all over the Island including Mid-Island and South Shore who have lost jobs, become disabled, and have no means of paying rent.

  We help direct these families to food resources, government benefit screening, job training, and referrals. We also promote wellness through workshops addressing issues such as cholesterol awareness, heart disease, and women's and men's health. We conduct cooking classes for children and we focus and helping to promote literacy and education through book distribution, storytelling, art exhibits, encouraging kids to attend educational programs such as basic astronomy, reading, writing and math at local institutions. We show families the importance of cultural exposure by conducting art shows and art exhibits at museums and much more.
