  SCO Family of Services operates three family residences that provide temporary shelter and assistance for up to 212 families in Brooklyn and the Bronx. We offer job readiness and self-sufficiency courses as well as childcare services which parents can utilize while they seek long-term housing. Our focus throughout is the family unit. We help families find appropriate permanent housing and assist them in finding the appropriate neighborhood services that will help them stay there.
