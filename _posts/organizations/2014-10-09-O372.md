mission: |
  Earth’s Birthday Project educates children about the Earth—its beauty, resources and conservation. Our programs engage children in scientific inquiry and empower them to act as informed and responsible citizens. Since Earth’s Birthday Project’s founding in 1989, more than 15 million children have participated in Hands-on Classroom activities and the Big Gift to the Earth. The key to our success is the tens of thousands of teachers who volunteer their resources and time to make EBP activities available to their students.
