  PETA is the world's largest animal rights organization, and we take on anyone who abuses animals. From schools that don’t allow the choice not to dissect to fashion designers who won’t drop fur to fast-food giants that refuse to treat their animals right—if cruelty to animals is taking place, you can bet PETA will be on it. 

  Our goal is to arm you with all the info, literature, advice, and stickers you need to get active for animals. If you're 12 & under, check us out at PETAKids.com. If you're 13 & up, peta2.com is the place to be.

  Hi! As the manager of Youth Campaigns for PETA, I work with kids who want to get active at school and in their communities to help educate people about how animals are treated. I've worked at PETA for five years year now, and I absolutely love it! I enjoy hearing from kids and helping them to help animals, so please do let me know if there's anything I can do to help you!
