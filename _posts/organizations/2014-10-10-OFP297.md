  We rescue cats from the euthanasia lists of local shelters. Then we bring them to a Vet to get their shots and tested for any diseases and spay and neuter them so there will be less unwanted cats.  We foster them until we think they are ready to be adopted.  When ready we put them on our website and in our adoption center and match them with the right family so they will have a forever home.
mission: |
  We are a non-profit, home-based group of volunteers responsible for aiding, fostering, and providing care to abandoned, feral, stray, and surrendered felines. The cats are rescued from high-kill shelters and the street. All animals brought to Feline Rescue of Staten Island are temperament tested, brought to a veterinarian and tested for common diseases, given full vaccinations, and spay/neutered. Volunteers assist in fostering and giving the cats the tender loving care they desperately need while they wait to be adopted into permanent homes

  I've always loved animals.  I have adopted animals all my life and when an opportunity came for me to help I went to Animal Care And Control 12 yrs ago to start saving cats. We have expanded greatly and now currently own a safe haven for cats in Granby, CT
