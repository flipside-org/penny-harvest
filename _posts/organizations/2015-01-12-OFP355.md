  New Eyes provides new eyeglasses to children and adults who have no money to pay for them. New Eyes is usually the last resource that these people have to get the eyeglasses they need to see clearly so that they can succeed at school, find jobs and live more productive and independent lives. New Eyes also accepts used glasses and distributes them overseas to the poor in developing countries. These are most times the first and only pair of eyeglasses the overseas recipients will ever own. (Used glasses cannot be recycled in the United States due to federal regulations).
mission: |
  New Eyes for the Needy purchases new prescription eyeglasses through a voucher program for children and adults in the United States who cannot afford glasses on their own.  New Eyes accepts, recycles and distributes donated glasses for poor people overseas.

    New Eyes buys new eyeglasses for U.S. residents through a voucher program. Our clients can take the voucher to any optical store and get a pair of glasses in exchange for the voucher. New Eyes pays the optical store directly.   One pair of glasses costs New Eyes $60 (compared to the U.S. average of over $200).

    Students can run a used glasses collection drive. Used glasses are  sorted at New Eyes into different categories (reading, bifocal, children's, sunglasses, astigmatic, etc.) and then shipped overseas for distribution in developing countries.
