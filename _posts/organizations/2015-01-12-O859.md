description: 
mission: |
  The National Coalition for the Homeless is a national network of people currently experiencing or have experienced homelessness, activists/advocates, community-based/faith-based service providers, and others committed to a single mission. That mission is to end homelessness. We are committed to creating the systemic and attitudinal changes necessary to prevent and end homelessness. At the same time, we work to meet the immediate needs of people who are currently experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of doing so. We take as our first principle of practice that people who are currently experiencing homelessness or have formerly experienced homelessness must be actively involved in all of our work. Toward this end, NCH engages in public education, policy advocacy, and grassroots organizing. We focus in 4 areas: housing justice, economic justice, health care justice, and civil rights.
