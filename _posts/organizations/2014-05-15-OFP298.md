  I secure donations for KPE and manage donor relations.  I am a co-founder of the organization and have been developing it over the last three years.  KPE began working with Common Cents schools in January 2010 after Haiti's earthquake.  Thus far, donations from the Penny Harvest have helped KPE to support students just like you through tough economic times.  In addition to full tuition, KPE has provided tents, hygienic items, emergency medical care, and water filters.  We look forward to your continued support!  Thank you for your interest in KPE!
