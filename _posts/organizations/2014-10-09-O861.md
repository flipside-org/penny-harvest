mission: |
  Fuel Up to Play 60 is the in-school nutrition and physical activity program founded by National Dairy Council® (NDC) and the National Football League, based on a mutual commitment to the health of the next generation. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has joined the effort as well as many businesses and industry leaders. This comprehensive program focuses on promoting healthier eating and more physical activity opportunities schoolwide. Students and adults work together to select and implement a series of "Plays" that result in long-term changes in these two important areas. Along the way, students become empowered to lead – by making healthy decisions, taking action for change and encouraging their friends to do the same.
