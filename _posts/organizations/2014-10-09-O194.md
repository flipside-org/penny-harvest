mission: |
  Brown Dog Foundation is a 501c3 public charity that provides funding to families who find themselves with a sick pet that will likely respond to treatment, but due to an unforseen circumstance, there is not enough money immediately available to make it happen. Founder Carol Smock hopes that knowing this foundation exists, dog-owners will have their dogs tested for cancer more frequently.
