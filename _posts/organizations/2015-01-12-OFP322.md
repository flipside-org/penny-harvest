  The Salvation Army is a strong helper and supporter of the poor.  Our part in the community is to provide food for the needy in the community, help with toys for children in the Christmas season, give tickets for furniture and clothing, and help pay for their light and gas bills if we have the money.  We give out free used and some new coats in the winter for people and children who cannot buy them.  We send our chldren to Star Lake Campe for free in the summer, we have an after school program where children get help with homework, do arts and crafts, get karate and dance lessons and we have a computer room for them.   The children also get a home cooked meal when they come in after school.  We provide the people in the community with a Thanksgiving meal.  We help everyone that comes through our doors in whatever way we can, and it doesn't matter if they are from different race, religion or sexual choice.  There are many other ways that we help the poor.

  Hi I'm Mariana,  thank you for viewing our page.  I am the social worker for The Salvation Army in Brownsville for 9 years.   I help people with food, help them pay their rent, furniture, and utilities, give clothes and toys.  Once before we worked with a school who was collecting pennies to help out the community with groceries.  When the people in the community received the canned goods and fresh frozen meat, and were told that it came from children, they were very happy and had a "Kool Aide" smile on their faces.   That day was "the BOMB" for them.  We hope you decide to work with us in feeding the community again.
