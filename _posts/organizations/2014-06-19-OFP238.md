mission: |
  Rachelâ€™s Joy Maternity Home tailors the services we offer to the needs of the young women who come to us. Realizing that it is not enough to just tell a young woman not to abort her child, we are committed to helping her during her time of greatest need. We have a large 10 room house in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. We are able to more effectively help the young unwed mothers who come to us needing assistance. The home is able to facilitate between four to eight mothers and their babies.

  My name is Susan and I started this shelter in 1989.  It is a blessing to be able to help desperate homeless mothers and their infant babies get off living in the streets and come into a nice warm, friendly home.
