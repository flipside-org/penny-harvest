  Like many of you, I love animals so working at Animal Care & Control is the perfect job for me.  We take care of more than 30,000 animals each year.  Imagine having 600 animals show up at your door each week in need of someone to take care of them.  The animals include dogs, cats, rabbits, goats, sheep, chickens, cows, snakes, turtles and even a tiger.  All the animals need to be fed, walked, cages cleaned, and given toys and blankets each day.  AC&C has worked with Common Cents schools in the past and the money we receive helps us to take good care of the animals in our shelters until we can find them a permanent home.
