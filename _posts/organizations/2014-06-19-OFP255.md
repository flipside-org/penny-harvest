  Imagine you had a disease that destroyed your skin, heart, brain, kidneys or lungs.  Over 1.5 million Americans have this chronic illness called Lupus and for over 40 years, the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation has been helping those in the NYC area affected by this devastating disease.  The Foundation does this by educating and informing the public about the disease, supporting scientists who are trying to find a cure for lupus, and offering services to patients and their families.  We have offices in Manhattan, East Harlem, the Bronx and Brooklyn and work with the community to increase awareness of lupus so that we can increase early diagnosis.

    Children suffering from lupus have difficult lives. The Foundation’s Let Kids be Kids program was designed to help kids affected by lupus feel like other kids their age.  The program grants awards to cover the costs of participation in activities such as after-school lessons in art and music, swimming or tai chi, and basketball camp.  Awards also cover needs such as clothing, medication and supplies for school.  Also, each year in August, we send families from the NYC area to Lupus Week at Camp Sunshine.  Last summer, we sent a total of 33 families.  This is a great place for kids with lupus to make friends with kids just like them!  The cost to send one family is about $1,000, so any amount really helps the kids and their families.

    The S.L.E. Lupus Foundation Lupus Emergency Grant program assists individuals with lupus during particularly difficult times. These grants enable patients to purchase medication, buy warm clothing, pay medical bills, and a variety of other needs.  Emergency Grants are $400 or less and are awarded to lupus patients and their families who are in immediate need of financial assistance.  Thanks to Penny Harvest’s support, this year we were able to help a single mom with 3 children who also has lupus take her teacher’s exam.  Now she can teach kids your age just like your teacher and be able to support her family!

    SUMMER INTERNSHIP PROGRAM Established in 2001, the Summer Internship Program plays an integral supporting role in the growth and success of the Cooperative outreach program.  Each summer, in collaboration with the Children’s Aid Society Youth Intervention Program, LCNY arranges for five high school students from the Cooperative communities to participate in paid internships.  As the students work to increase our community outreach efforts, raise public awareness and provide administrative support to the staff, they are developing important life skills and learning about the value of community service.   The interns’ daily activities include distributing information about lupus and the Cooperative to community organizations, stores, etc., attending health fairs and assisting the staff with their preparations for the fall patient and professional education conferences.

  Hello, my name is Lana; I work with the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation.  I help to raise money for all of the people in New York City who suffer from lupus.  The dollars we raise supports a wide variety of programs, including counseling services for sick patients and their families, medical research to help find a cure and special programs for children that are sick with lupus.  I really like what I do because I get to help people every day. We received a lot of support from the Common Cents program last year and we were very grateful, in fact, you helped send a little girl with lupus and her family to Camp Sunshine in Maine for a whole week!  Thanks for your support Common Cents!
