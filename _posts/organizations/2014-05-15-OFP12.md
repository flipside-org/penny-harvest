  The American Cancer Society helps cancer patients and their families through education, research, and programs.  Education teaches our youth and adults how to avoid certain cancers like lung cancer by avoiding smoking. We have a program called Staten Island Quits which we hope will help to reduce the number of teens on Staten Island that smoke. We help children and families who have someone with cancer through many of our patient and family services programs. We also help to support research to find a cure for all cancers.
mission: |
  The American Cancer Society has been waging war against cancer for nearly a century, and our commitment to defeating the disease has never wavered. Our lifesaving efforts are funded exclusively by the generosity of donors like you. Since 1993 Making Strides Against Breast Cancer® has raised more than $100 million in additional funding to support the Society’s breast cancer research, education, advocacy, and patient services.

    he American Cancer Society has a place where cancer patients and their caregivers can find help and hope when home is far away - an American Cancer Society Hope Lodge.

    

    Each Hope Lodge offers cancer patients and their caregivers a free, temporary place to stay when their best hope for effective treatment may be in another city. Not having to worry about where to stay or how to pay for lodging allows guests to focus on getting well. 

    Currently, there are 31 Hope Lodge locations throughout the United States including one in NYC where many Staten Island residents have stayed. While the cost of Hope Lodge is free to patients and their caregivers, ut the value that they receive is worth $500/night (based on the cost of lodging at this location and quality).

  Hi! I started working for the American Cancer Society in Fall of 2012 after volunteering for several years at my college. I am excited to begin a career that allows me to fight back against cancer. While this year will be my first year working with Common Cents, I look forward to getting to know you at your round tables!
