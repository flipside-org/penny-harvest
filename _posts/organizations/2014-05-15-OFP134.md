  We are a health care facility for people over the age of 18.  We provide nursing care, rehabilitation, activities, and meals for our residents.  Additionally, we have community programs where we care for people who need medical care, but live at home. We also have a children's day care center and a community program for people over 50 years old that like to go on trips, events, and workshops.  We even train people for free and then hire them to become Home Health Aides and Certified Nurses Assistants.

  My name is Sarah Crespo and I have been working at Isabella for over 20 years now.  I enjoy working here because I feel good about helping people in need.  Everyone is going to get sick one day and/or get older and will need help from someone.  So I like to help and one day, someone will help me.

  

  I have helped Common Cents schools in the past by organizing visits and tours with our residents.  The kids love coming here and seeing everything we do.  They enjoy giving gifts to the residents and taking pictures and asking them questions.

  

  When they leave, they are happy they visited and happy they helped and donated money to us.
