  Emmaus House is a community of  homeless people that assist other homeless people and the neighboring poor, by providing pantries of clothing and food,  and referrals for services needed. We also go out twice a week to feed and take warm blankets and clothing to the many homeless still out on the streets. We give food in our pantry twice a month to the many who need help stretching their food budget during the month.  

  We are located on 120th street, and we have a clothing pantry, food pantry, and a traveling kitchen.

  I have been a part of Emmaus for over 20 years now first as a resident and now as a part of the governing body.  Emmaus House/Harlem has been in existence in Harlem   for the last 43 yrs.  I love the work I do here because having been homeless and an abuser of illegal substances for many years, God has blessed me to turn my life around and it is a joy to be able to help someone or prevent someone from going through the devastation that I went through.
