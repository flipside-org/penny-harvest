  Shouldn't every child get the chance to go the school their parents think is best for them? We certainly think so! Many parents would like to send their children to private schools but they cannot afford the tuition. Children's Scholarship Fund gives those families scholarships that pay for part of the tuition. Here in New York City, we help more than 8,000 children go to private and parochial schools in all five boroughs. To qualify for a scholarship, all the family has to do is prove that they have a low income - it doesn't matter what kind of grades they are getting. And when one child in the family gets chosen for our program, his or her brothers and sisters get a scholarship also.

    We award partial scholarships so children can attend private school. An average scholarship in NYC is $1,926, so a donation of $963 would pay for one student for half the school year, or $192 would pay for a student for one month of the school year.

    Students could write letters and do artwork for our donors telling them why they chose to give to our charity. They could also help us with stuffing envelopes to go out in the mail. There are also opportunities to do service projects at participating private schools where we have scholarship recipients.

  Hi, I have been working at the Children's Scholarship Fund for about 14 years, almost as long as the organization has been around. My work here includes: writing appeal letters asking people to donate money for scholarships, writing stories for our newsletters and our website, and grant-writing. My favorite part of the job is meeting parents and children who are really grateful that our scholarships allow them to attend schools where they are learning and where they feel safe.
