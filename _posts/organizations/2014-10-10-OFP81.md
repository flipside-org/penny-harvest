  Do you know someone who is hard of hearing or deaf?  Imagine what it would be like to not be able to hear the telephone, a door knock, the smoke alarm, a baby cry, or someone calling your name.  It is scary and hard to get through each day when you can't hear.  Dogs for the Deaf rescues dogs from shelters, saving their lives.  Then the dogs are trained to alert their person to everyday sounds that are all around us.  When the dog hears a door knock, phone ring, smoke alarm, oven timer, or any other sound, it runs to its person, jumps up and puts its front paws on the person's leg, and then takes the person to the sound.  Like magic, the deaf person knows what is going on.

  

  Do you know someone with autism?  Dogs for the Deaf trains are dogs to enhance the safety of children with autism. The dogs also help calm the children and increase their ability to communicate and to learn.  These special dogs and special children become great friends, too.

  

  Program Assistance dogs go to work with and assist doctors, teachers, counselors and help calm the children so they can learn better or be treated more effectively by their doctors or counselors.  These dogs help many children and adults every day so they can learn more or be more healthy.

  

  All of these special dogs are rescued from shelters.

  
mission: |
  Dogs for the Deaf rescues dogs from shelters and professionally trains them to assist deaf people and enhance their lives.

cash_grants: yes
grants:

    Dog Vaccinations:  All dogs coming from the shelters must receive shots to make sure they are healthy.  The average cost for vaccinations for each dog is $50.00.  A $500 grant would provide vaccinations for 10 dogs, and a $1,000 grant would provide vaccinations for 20 dogs.
  - |
    The average adoption fee at the shelters is $100.00.  So, a $500.00 grant would enable us to adopt five dogs, and a $1,000 grant would enable us to adopt ten dogs.

    It would be a great help to have you distribute our newsletters to various places such as doctors' offices, veterinarians' offices, and any other places where people might be interested in Dogs for the Deaf.  We could send boxes of newsletters to the schools, and you could research places to take them.  Then you could go to the places and ask if it is OK to leave a few copies of the newsletter in the waiting room.

    

    This would be an excellent way for you to help spread word of the special work we do to rescue dogs and help people.  Hopefully the people reading the newsletter will write for more information and even send in donations.  This way you will be helping us increase our donations, and then we will be able to rescue and train more dogs to help more people.  Let us know if you want us to send your school a box of newsletters.

  I started working at Dogs for the Deaf 32 years ago as a trainer.  After training many Hearing Dogs and working hard, I was promoted to Assistant Director and then to President/CEO.  Dogs for the Deaf is a wonderful organization that makes miracles happen everyday by providing specially trained dogs to help people in need.  I love the people we help and I love the dogs.  It is a WIN/WIN place to work.  Common Cents grants have been very special to Dogs for the Deaf and have helped us in the important work of rescuing dogs and helping people.
