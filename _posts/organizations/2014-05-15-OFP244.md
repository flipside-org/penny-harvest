  Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) & Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is an incredible painful condition that is also difficult to treat, and the diagnosis is increasing in children. Our goal is to promote greater awareness of CRPS and Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome (RSDS) so that individuals will receive early intervention and successfully recover.

  Our mission is to promote public and professional awareness of CRPS and to educate those afflicted with the syndrome, their families, friends, insurance and healthcare providers on the disabling pain it causes. We encourage individuals with CRPS to offer each other emotional support within affiliate groups. Finally, we are committed to raising funds for research into the cause and cure of CRPS.
