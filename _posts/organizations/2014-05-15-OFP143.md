  Sometimes people are born developmentally disabled.  That means they will always need extra help to learn and do things.  When they grow up and finish school, sometimes they still need extra help to learn doing simple everyday things that you and I already know how to do.  At Lifestyles for the Disabled, we help them learn to do things like clearing & wiping the table, washing dishes, and helping around the house.  Sometimes we help them to go see a movie, go bowling or going out to a restaurant to eat with friends.  At Lifestyles for the Disabled we also have many work programs they can do during the day  like doing laundry, or cooking and serving in a real restaurant, or growing flowers and plants to make homes, schools and hospitals in Staten Island prettier.  Thank you for wanting to find out more about us!

    At Lifestyles for the Disabled we have many work programs like doing laundry, or cooking and serving in a real restaurant, or growing flowers and plants to make homes, schools and hospitals in Staten Island prettier.  Our Greenhouse Program has special needs that our other programs do not.  When we teach our “disabled workers” to do planting, weeding and potting flowers and vegetables, our equipment sometimes breaks or wears out.  Since we have real greenhouses and large gardens, we need to use “professional grade” tools and equipment that cost more.  They are larger and heavy-duty but due to constant use, these tools and equipment still manage to break or wear-out.  We always need to replace gloves and tools.  We also need to buy pots and trays for plants, seeds, and seedlings and top soil for growing the plants.  Your help is greatly appreciated!

  I used to work with NYC Bus, but I am now retired.  My daughter Samantha is one of the special children that need extra time and help to learn to do things.  There are many things she will not ever learn to do.  So the work of Lifestyles has a special meaning for me.  Fall of 2007, I began working part-time with Lifestyles and work mostly on contracts and grants.  A year latter, I became my ageny's contact with the wonderful Penny Harvest program.
