mission: |
  Almost Home Animal Rescue and Adoption, Inc. is a non-profit organization that was formed by a group of dedicated  and compassionate volunteers with many years of shelter experience. Almost Home maintains a no-kill policy towards animals and treats families that come to us with respect.

  

  Our goal is to find each family a dog or cat that makes their home complete. We also help families to keep the pets they currently have. Our mission at Almost Home is to rescue and re-home unwanted and abandoned dogs and cats from private homes and municipal shelters, and to place them into responsible homes.
