  KittyKaretakers of Queens is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to educating people regarding their responsibilities as guardians of animals (four-legged kids).  We are involved in rescue, adoption and trap-neuter-return of stray and abused cats and kittens.  We have gotten hundreds of animals adopted as well as spayed and neutered.  Our volunteers are school age young adults (with supervision) doing a variety of jobs for our "kids."

    Students can visit various locations with supervision and help care for the cats.  Feeding, playing, socializing, cleaning are just some of the activities volunteers can accomplish.

    Students can help on adoption days at the participating events held at various locations throughout the city.    Help is always needed to help set up the cages and kennels; make the cages ready for the 4-legged "kids" (cats and kittens) by filling litter boxes, getting food and water ready; and playing with cats / kittens during the day to help entertain them.  We generally do two off-site events a month during spring and summer, and volunteers are very important.

  I am a volunteer who loves animals and decided to help give each of them a really happy and healthy life while they are waiting for their new homes.  I have been helping four-legged kids for approximately 2 years and loving every minute of it.  I look forward to the  opportunity of working with Common Cents.
