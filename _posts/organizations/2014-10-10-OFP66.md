  Now serving New York City for more than 25 years, City Harvest (www.CityHarvest.org) is the world's first food rescue organization, dedicated to feeding the city's hungry men, women, and children. This year, City Harvest will collect more than 30 million pounds of excess food from all segments of the food industry, including restaurants, grocers, corporate cafeterias, manufacturers, and farms. This food is then delivered free of charge to nearly 600 community food programs throughout New Nork City using a fleet of trucks and bikes as well as volunteers on foot. Each week, City Harvest helps over 300,000 hungry New Yorkers find their next meal.
mission: |
  City Harvest is committed to feeding hungry people in New York City using a variety of innovative, practical and cost-effective methods. Our primary approach is to rescue food that otherwise would be wasted and deliver it to those who serve the hungry. City Harvest strives to be a model for others to fight hunger in their communities.

  Hi there! My name is Kristin and I have been working for City Harvest since July 2011. I recruit and train volunteers to help City Harvest feed hungry New Yorkers as well as work with community partners like schools. Volunteers and community partners help us to rescue and distribute thousands and thousands of pounds of great food every day to people who need it most.
