mission: |
  Anoopa Sharma was a passionate philanthropist who was killed in a car accident at the age of 25.  To honor Anoopa and her wishes to help the needy, her family has established the Anoopa Sharma Children's Foundation (ASCF). The Fund will provide support for a school in North India which Anoopa visited in the summer of 2004. The school is the girls’ high school in a small village called Atrauli in the state of Uttar Pradesh.  Anoopa was appalled and saddened to find so much lacking in basic school needs. She agreed she would find some way to help improve the conditions at the school - merit scholarships, library, desks and chairs, drinking water fountain, repair of classrooms and other much needed facilities at the school. The Sharma’s hope that the people whom Anoopa touched might find this a fitting and gratifying opportunity to help execute a project Anoopa hoped to work on herself.
