  One penny may not seem like much.  But when you take time to search out a few cents, you can make a lot of positive change in this world.  The students in Kenya are just like you.  They dream of being doctors, veterinarians, pilots and scientists.  They also know that they need to finish school in order to reach these dreams.  And that is something you can help them with by harvesting pennies that can pay for their school fees!

    A gift on $1200 will be matched by the KEF for a total of $2400, which is enough to provide one student with tuition for all four years of high school!

    Children are able to do both collection drives for their colleagues in Kenya, as well as start a pen-pal correspondence with them.  The KEF works with several US schools in fostering pen-pal relationships with Kenyan schools.  It is a rewarding experience that children of any grade level can participate in.

    In June 2008, the Thurgood Marshall Magnet School in Jamaica, NY raised $600 for the KEF through the Penny Harvest.  In a gesture of appreciation, KEF executive Director, Brad Broder, visited the school and gave a presentation to 300 4th and 5th grade students.  The presentation included showing the students the KEF's promotional video, doing a PowerPoint presentation and answering questions about students' lives in Kenya.  This helps students gain some perspective on how fortunate they are to live in the US, as well as shows them where the money they collected is going and who it is helping.

  Hi.  My name is Bradley Broder and I'm the founder and executive director of the Kenya Education Fund, or KEF.  Since starting the KEF my job has been to raise money in the US so that the KEF can enroll poor Kenyan students in high schools and colleges throughout their country.  To help me do my job, Penny Harvesters from Thurgood Marshall Magnet School in Queens, NY have collected hundreds of dollars that will translate into a whole year of schooling for one lucky student in Kenya!  You too can help a Kenyan student go to school by doing a Penny Harvest at your school.  It's fun and easy and you get to make a positive difference in the world.
