mission: |
  Our mission is to help ease the financial and emotional burdens that childhood cancer places upon a family, while providing comfort to children as they cope with the extended hospital stays, often associated with their illness. The Lexiebean Foundation will supply care packages to patients, parents and their siblings; while providing financial aid to families on a case-by-case basis.
