mission: |
  Operating under GRACE International, Inc., the Bed Stuy Campaign Against Hunger is a non-profit organization, working vigorously to end hunger in the Bedford-Stuyvesant / Brownsville / Ocean Hill neighborhoods of Brooklyn. To do this, we provide emergency food, and other social services including Food Stamp screenings, Brooklynâ€™s only community focused urban garden and assistance with enrollment in publicly-supported health insurance.

Our mission is to end hunger by distributing food and empowering families through information and support, which will give both strength and dignity to the community.
