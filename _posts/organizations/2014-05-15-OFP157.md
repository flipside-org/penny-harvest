  Can you imagine being sick and not being able to go the doctor or get medicine that will help you feel better? Many grandmas, grandpas and other older adults in New York City can’t get the medicine or care that they need to stay healthy. The Medicare Rights Center is here to help them. We have a hotline, a web site, training programs and presentations that people can use to get answers to questions about staying healthy on a budget. Your pennies will help us help them.
