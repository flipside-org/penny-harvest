  I am currently the Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics and the Director of Adolescent Medicine here at Coney Island Hospital.  I have been at Coney Island Hospital for the past 17 years and direct the vision and mission of the department.  We care for infants, children, adolescents and young adults between the ages of birth to 21 years.  Our patients are primarily from poor and working class families, many of whom are recent immigrants to this country.  They are faced with many challenges in addition to requiring needed medical care including preventive care, e.g. immunizations.  As a city hospital, we are committed to making southern Brooklyn's communities the healthiest in New York City, through initiatives aimed at health promotion, disease precention and early detection.
