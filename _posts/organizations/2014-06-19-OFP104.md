  The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park believes in giving children a chance to have fun through learning, exploring, and improving our local environment. Whether the activity is planting a tree, finding some insects, pulling weeds, seeing a tomato grow, finding animals in the lake, or digging through the dirt, we hope to show the great experience that Van Cortlandt Park offers.
mission: |
  Friends of Van Cortlandt Park is dedicated to the conservation of New York's third largest park. Scenic trails, historic landmarks, forests and the borough's largest lake make up the beautiful landscape.

     Van Cortlandt Adventures is our line of programs that gets kids out into nature to explore the lake and forest of Van Cortlandt Park.  Forester for a Day and Freshwater Ecology are two of these programs that need funding to replace the materials we use with children in the Park. Money received would be used towards refilling our water and soil testing kits ($100 each), replace our aquatic dip nets ($200), replace old shovels ($300) and purchase plant materials ($400). All of our programs in addition to our Van Cortlandt Adventures childrenâ€™s programs are free and donations ensure that they stay that way.

    Our line of programs includes a garden located in our compost site. Children, teenagers, and adults of all ages come to the compost site to learn about the environmental benefits of composting and how much fun it is to break down compostable products into soil that nurtures plants. The compost that our volunteers help us break down into soil is used to nourish our vegetable garden. A donation of $500 would allow us to buy plants and seeds for our vegetable beds, or can be used towards plants to start a butterfly garden.

    Students can come into the forest with us to maintain the trails and plant trees. They would get the chance to roll up their sleeves and pull invasive plants, plant native ones and remove trash from along the trails. This is a great opportunity for students to help us achieve one of our main goals of restoring the trails of Van Cortlandt Park.

    Service opportunity 2: Students could come and work in our compost site/garden. We would teach them the basics about composting and then show them how to turn and sift the compost bins. Depending on the time of year students can also help us plant, water, weed, and perform upkeep of our garden.

  I have been with the Friends since September of 2000 and enjoy working outdoors teaching people about Van Cortlandt Park and the importance of preserving the environment.  I conduct many of the Friends programs where I work with kids as young as 3 and adults as old as 99.  I enjoy leading the Van Cortlandt Adventures programs with school groups the most because of the youthful enthusiasm and excitement to learn that children so often exhibit when they come to the Park for one of our programs.
