mission: |
  The American Cancer Society is trying to make this difficult situation easier for cancer patients and their families through 26 Hope Lodges – free, temporary housing facilities for cancer patients who are undergoing treatment. But Hope Lodges are more than just a place to stay – they provide a home-like nurturing environment, so patients can get support from others going through the same experience. A cancer survivor’s recovery involves much more than medical treatments; it takes hope to heal. Hope Lodge offers the warmth and security of home in a setting where the love and encouragement of others enlighten and inspire guests. At Hope Lodge, guests rally around each other, building life-affirming connections and lifetime friendships.
