  Social Tees Animal Rescue (S.T.A.R.) is a non-profit, strictly no-kill 501c3 organization that takes abandoned animals from the kill shelters and provides them with a safe haven and veterinary care until they are placed in a proper home. We rescue, rehabilitate and place over 3000 dogs, cats, birds and reptiles per year.
