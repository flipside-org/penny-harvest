  Hello. My name is Richard Holley. In 1979 a few of my fellow healthcare co-workers and I founded Food For Children to help respond to the lack of food and medicines affecting miilions of children throughout the world each year. Our mission is to help as many children as possible receive the nutrition, clean water, medicines and vaccinations they need to lead healthy and happy lives. We also work with our partner organizations to provide homes and schooling for children who have lost their parents to AIDS.
