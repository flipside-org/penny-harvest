mission: |
  Did you know that cancer is the leading cause of death among children in the United States? Nearly ten-thousand kids are diagnosed each year. Have a Heart Children's Cancer Society was formed for the sole purpose of improving the quality of life for these courageous children and their families. Our team is dedicated to collaborating with hospitals, medical centers and other children's organizations to locate families who have financially fallen prey to this debilitating disease. Once identified, we are able to assist them with medical bills, treatments, equipment, transportation and household expenses.

  My name is Kerry Walters. I am the Vice President for Have a Heart Children's Cancer Society.  We help families who have children with cancer. Often when a child has cancer, one or both parents may need to stop working to take care of their child.  They may need to bring their child to doctors’ appointments or to the hospital for treatment.  The family may have some trouble paying bills for medical expenses (e.g. treatment, transportation, and lodging) and household bills (e.g. rent, mortgage, utility, car payments).  This is where we help.  We take care of paying some of the family's bills.  This way the family can focus all of their attention on their child's medical care and not have to worry about how they are going to pay for some of their medical and household expenses.  We try to make things easier for these families-----who are already going through a very tough time in their lives.  Thank you for considering Have a Heart Children's Cancer Society for your school’s Common Cents Penny Harvest funds. Together we can make a difference so contact me for all kinds of ideas and thank you so much!
