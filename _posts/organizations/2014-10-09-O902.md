mission: |
  No More Tears Rescue's main goal is to save puppy mill dogs who can no longer breed for profit. We rescue and rehabilitate these unsocialized dogs and most have numerous medical issues that need attention. Finding their forever homes is not easy and consists of patience, love, and understanding. The end result is rewarding once the dogs learn to trust and give unconditional love for the very first time in their lives. This process costs a lot of money, so any donation made is much appreciated and goes to help save more dogs.
