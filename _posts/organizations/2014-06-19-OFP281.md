  Starlight Children’s Foundation NY*NJ*CT exists to brighten the lives of seriously ill children.  Our programs are designed to restore some of the laughter and happiness that a serious illness takes away from children and allow them to experience some of the simple joys of childhood.  
mission: |
  Starlight Children’s Foundation is an international non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for seriously ill children and their families. Working with more than 1000 hospitals, the Foundation provides an impressive menu of both in-hospital and outpatient programs and services. A leader in delivering distractive entertainment, Starlight's programs benefit over 100,000 children each month.

cash_grants: yes
grants:

    $150 sends a Starlight clown to an area hospital to entertain sick children.  Bringing fun and laughter to hospital gatherings and directly to a child's bedsides are all a part of what they do.    
  - |
    $25 sends a cuddly Teddy Bear to a hospitalized child so a $500 grant would provide 20 teddy bears for children.  Sending a cuddly Teddy Bear to a hospitalized child suffering from a serious illness can make a world of difference.  A Teddy Bear can provide the support and comfort a child needs during a scary doctors’ appointment, ease their nervousness before a surgery and cuddle with them in recovery.

    Children can gather fun and useful things to occupy a child’s time and attention while in the hospital, such as small stuffed animals, crayons, coloring books, puzzles, hand sanitizers, tissues, toothbrushes, etc.  These items are placed into a small child’s backpack that Starlight provides and are then given to children when they enter the hospital.

    Children collect craft supplies to be sent to an area hospital.  These craft supplies such as crayons, coloring books, beads, pipe cleaners, tissue paper etc. enable hospitalized children to create art works and have fun while in the hospital.  Craft projects offer fun and much needed distraction.
