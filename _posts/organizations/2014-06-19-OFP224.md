  Being homeless is really scary and it can be hard to get your life back on track when you have no place to live. Project Renewal helps homeless men and women in New York City leave the streets and start a new life in a new home. In addition to housing, we provide health care, addiction treatment, and job training -- everything a homeless person needs to get well!

    Once the men and women we work with have their own home, they often come to our food pantry to stock their kitchen cabinets. At Project Renewal, we are alway in need of canned goods and other non-perishable food items. A food drive would help our clients prepare healthy meals within their budget.

  Hello, my name is Kelsey! I have been working at Project Renewal since August of 2012, although we have had the pleasure of working with Common Cents since 2003! Here at Project Renewal, I work in our fundraising department, making sure we have enough money to help all the homeless men and women who come to us for recovery. I look forward to working with students like you who are dedicated to making New York City a better place for all of us!
