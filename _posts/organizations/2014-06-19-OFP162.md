  Mount Gilead Baptist Church is a missionary church. That means we believe that people are the mission that Christ came to save. People in need were the center focus of Christ’s ministry. We at Mount Gilead strive to fulfill the mission of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and lifting up those who have fallen down. We do this first with love and then with meeting some of the practical needs of individuals. We are blessed solely to be a blessing to others.

  We at Mount Gilead Baptist Church love the Lord and we love the people who God has placed in our reach. We currently run a food pantry and clothing giveaway. In 2007-8 alone we have distributed over 20,000 bags of food which went to feed men, woman and children in our University Heights community. Weekly we turn away 10-15 families because we just don't have the space or food. God has no hand but ours.
