  Do you like animals? Do you live with a pet?

  

  Well every year about 36,000 pets are brought to the city shelter because they are homeless or their owners couldn't keep them. 

  Our goal is to find homes for all healthy and friendly pets by working as a team with other rescue groups. 

  Since 2003, we have saved the lives of more than 230,000 NYC dogs and cats!

  

  One of our programs that helps us reach this goal is our Wheels of Hope animal transport program.

  

  Wheels of Hope provides transportation for thousands of New York City animals, bringing them to foster and adoptive homes, veterinary offices and rescue groups. It allows for the transportation of dozens of animals at once - at no cost to the rescue groups - in our City where this would otherwise not be possible.

  

  With more money and resources we can help even more pets in NYC.

  The Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals, Inc., is working with the City of New York toward the day when no New York City dog or cat of reasonable health and temperament is killed merely because he or she does not have a home.

    $50 will help pay for medication that will allow the sick and injured animals to feel better.

    

    $70 will fill one of our transport vans with gas one time – allowing us to drive up to 14 homeless dogs and cats to rescue groups and shelters that will help them find new homes.

    

    $200 will help pay for animals that need to stay overnight at the vet's office to ensure they receive 24hour care.

    

    $500 will pay significant portion of the veterinary bills of an injured or sick homeless animal. This can include casts for broken bones, X-rays, vaccines, and life saving surgeries. 

    $1000 will pay medical bills for several sick or injured homeless dogs or cats (depending on how seriously they are hurt) – so that they can heal and feel better – and find new families.

    We are helping the victims of Hurricane Sandy by transporting donated pet food, cat litter and supplies to the areas with the greatest need. Any amount of money or even donated pet food will go directly to the people and their pets in need.

    Donation drives at your school to collect used, but clean sheets, towels and blankets will help more pets at shelters have warm, soft bedding to sleep on at night.  

    (We can help you find a shelter that can use what you collect.)

    

    A bulletin board at your school can be used to show pictures of animals needing homes – and our office can e-mail updated photos so that you can keep the board current as pets find new homes.

    

    Students can write articles for school or other publications about the benefits of spaying or neutering your pet (so that they don't have babies - puppies or kittens).  We would be happy to provide information to help students interested in writing about spaying and neutering or other animal welfare topics.
