  Good day,

  I am the Director of Recreation and Volunteers at Buena Vida Continuing Care and Rehabilitation Center.  I enjoy working with student volunteers because many of our residents really enjoy seeing and talking with young adults and  children.  Your visits brighten up their day and I love to see the smiles and happiness you bring!  Some of our residents miss their family when they are here and the families might not be able to visit as much as they would like to because of work and other obligations.  You provide the residents with an opportunity to be with young people and learn about what is going on in the community.  I am so grateful for all of the students who have visited here.  Some schools have brought cards, and presents, some have sung songs, and all have brought much joy and happiness with them.  I look forward to working with your school.
