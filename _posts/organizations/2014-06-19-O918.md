  The Oasis Community Corporation is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001. Our mission is to support children in their social, emotional, and academic development by providing them with enriching, community-based after-school programs.

  Our goal is to help children become more confident, more responsible, and more involved in the world around them. Oasisâ€™ after-school programs provide homework help, sports and recreation activities, visual and performing arts, and academic enrichment activities such as literacy and computer robotics.
