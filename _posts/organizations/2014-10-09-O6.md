  Serenity House Family Residence is the largest transitional Tier II domestic violence shelter in Brooklyn, New York. Serenity House offers survivors (regardless of gender, race, culture, religion, ethnic background, or sexual preference) the opportunity to reside in a secured environment for up to six months or more, as needed. The program is culturally sensitive to allow families to feel immediately at home and to foster ethnic pride in children and family members. Serenity House is able to accommodate families including those with adolescent males and male head-of-household.
