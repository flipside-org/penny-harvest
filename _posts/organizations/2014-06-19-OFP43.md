  The mission of BBBS of NYC is to provide mentors to all disadvantaged children in New York City who need a caring adult role model in their lives – a special friend who can help to expand their horizons and enrich their futures. Research has proven that children with mentors improve their grades, grow in self esteem, and are less likely to get in trouble with law or start using drugs and alcohol.

  

  BBBS of NYC founded the national mentoring movement in 1904 and today remains the role model for mentoring agencies across the nation. Each year we serve thousands of New York City children and youth aged 7-18. We have a number of different programs so that we can meet the needs of everyone we serve including programs for new immigrants, teenage mothers, children with disabilities, children in foster care, youth who have been in trouble with the law, and children who’s parents have been arrested, . 

  In order to make sure that every child who needs a mentor receives one, BBBS of NYC has a special department called the Center for Training and Professional Development. This department works with other agencies throughout New York City, teaching them how to start youth mentoring programs of their own. Because we have over 100 years of experience, we are able to share our knowledge with these agencies so that they too can help needy children find safe mentoring programs. 
mission: |
  Big Brothers and Big Sisters are, foremost, friends to children: They share everyday activities, expand horizons, and experience the joy in even the simplest events. Within those little moments lies the big magic that a Big Brother or Big Sister brings to the life of a young person.

    One reason why BBBS of NYC mentoring is so effective in making a positive difference in the lives of young people is that we closely supervise each mentoring match. We have many different mentoring programs for different groups of young people, and in every one, our staff of professional social workers does a lot of work behind the scenes to screen volunteers, find the right big brother or sister (called a “Big”) for each little brother or sister (called a “Little”) and support them to make every mentoring match a success. A Penny Harvest donation would provide the funding towards one Big and one Little to be matched for one year.
