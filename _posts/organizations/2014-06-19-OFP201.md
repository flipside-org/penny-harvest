  The Food Pantry at Park Avenue Synagogue is a community service program entirely run by high school Students. Every week, throughout the year, students from high schools, in New York, come together to make packages for less fortunate people. The financial aspects are organized and the packages are entirely made by students. Every Friday our clients come to the Synagogue to receive, depending on the size of their families, a number of large and small packages. The packages include vegetables, pasta, beans, soup and more. We hand out an average of about 400 packages each week, and on Thanksgiving, more than 700 packages are handed out! The Food Pantry has been a continuous community service for 25 years. Throughout the years students have formed lifetime friendships with the clients. Each day we (the students) strive to improve the lives of others in whatever way we can!

    The programâ€™s annual budget is $90,000; it is based on congregant donations, the last five years have shown a significant increase in clients. These increases, combined with the rise in basic food costs, have put tremendous pressure on the ability of our budget to satisfy the demands of our purpose to serve all clients in our list. To answer the growing need we are in the process of joining the Food Bank of New York.  However, we are still in need of additional support.  We truly believe in the importance of our program and its positive contribution to the clients as well as our students and the pride our community takes in their work.

  Hi! My name is Leigh. I've worked at the Food Pantry for five years. This program is one of the most rewarding aspects of my life, and the lives of the other high schoolers I work with. To our clients, it is more than a bag of food.  It is an opportunity to see young students that are caring and involved; these students are willing to take action, with great compassion, to improve the lives of the members of our neighboring communities.  

  The magic in working with people in need, as students often discover after spending some time volunteering at our Food Pantry program, is the realization that one gets more than one actually gives.  Unlike many young students who are not engaged in similar activities, the Food Pantry provides our students with an opportunity to improve the lives of others, but it also opens their eyes to the world of others.  Often, this is the first encounter they have with people who are truly in need.  For many students, it is a life-changing experience.  When they later go to college, they have a better understanding of the complexity of the world, and they seek additional opportunities to engage in meaningful volunteer experiences. We only hope that we can continue the program with as much success as we have had in the past.
