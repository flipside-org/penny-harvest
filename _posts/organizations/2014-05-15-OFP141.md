  Lead Uganda exists to find, educate and grow LEADERS in Uganda, Africa.  We do not just simply pay for these kids to go to school.  We are a leadership program not just a charity.  We find bright, smart leaders that are AIDS orphans, child soldiers, child laborers and refugees and put them in the TOP schools in Uganda to help them become leaders and work to change Africa. Most children cannot afford school in Uganda let alone school fees for the top schools in the country.  We exist to find these kids that have a desire and yearning to want to help their country change and be a better place.  We help children that were abducted from their parents to become soldiers, or saw their parents killed, girls that were abused, kids working in rock quarries, and kids who have lost their parents to AIDS or have AIDS themselves.  Our kids are in the top schools in Uganda and are top in their class.  One of our third grade students, Victoria, came into the program last year and recently came in second at a country wide math contest.  She was VERY proud.  When the kids come into the leadership program they become a family.  They are from all different tribes in Africa and all different backgrounds but we give them a family.  The kids of LEAD Uganda will change their world and yours if given the best chance they can have.  You can help make that change.

    ANY type of fund raising you can do to raise money for the kids will help.  Performances, car washes, any kind of drive, helps the kids go to these top schools.  It takes only $1800 a year to pay for everything, including MEDICAL, for these kids in Uganda.  We would be more than happy to help with any fund raising you want to do.  There will also be 3 students coming to NY in the early spring and they could come to your school and talk to your school and help fund raise.

  Hi, I am Allison Moll, the new Director of Operations for LEAD Uganda.  I have been volunteering through my church for LEAD Uganda for over a year and just came on staff a couple of months ago because I believe in this cause SO greatly.  I have 3 young children who have helped raise money in their school's Penny Harvest, so I love the program and know what the excitement and hard work of children can do.  My husband got to go to Uganda last summer and meet the kids, so now I am even more determined and excited to work for this cause.  When I met some of the kids I was so moved.  You will be touched too by their stories, their determination and their inspiration.
