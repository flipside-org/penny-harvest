  Hope &  Hope helps children with cancer and blood disorders by providing funding to doctors, researchers and other medical professionals so they can do their very best work. This includes many programs and services that are free of charge to patients - things that we simply can't do without your help. Some of these things are acupuncture, massage, nutritional counseling and help with returning to school and thriving after treatment is done.  We also support the laboratory research that will help us understand how childhood cancer and blood disorders work and how to treat them better.

    Do a Band Aid drive! We always need Band Aids and for our kids the ones with colorful characters and colors are the best. A drive can also be done for small toys, like Hot Wheels cars and Polly Pocket dolls that we can used to stock our "Treasure Boxes," which we use when a patient has a procedure and needs a little surprise.

  I'm the Executive Director, which means the ultimate responsibility for running the organization lies with me. I've worked at Hope & Heroes since 2005 and I love it! Not only do I enjoy doing good in the world by helping children and families but I also have a personal reason for getting involved: my first child had a brain tumor. Even though we weren't able to successfully treat him, I knew that helping other families who were dealing with childhood cancer was what I wanted to do.
