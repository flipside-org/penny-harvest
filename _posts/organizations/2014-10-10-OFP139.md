  Kids With A Cause is a children's charity that encourages and

  empowers kids to make a difference. Our organization creates "hands-on" programs for kids to help kids and impact each other's lives.  We bring hope, happiness and opportunities to less fortunate children through a unique exchange  program between schools and facilities for disadvantaged youth. Each organization we assist experiences the importance and joy of giving and receiving through philanthropic efforts. We are helping to create a world of "young humanitarians in action." 

  Kids With A Cause, founded in 1999, facilitates volunteer programs and encourages youth to donate their time to give back to their communities and to the children of the world.

  

  We have conducted over 350 programs since our inception providing a helping hand to children in need both nationally and internationally.
mission: |
  Kids With A Cause is a multi-caused organization. We provide support and encouragement to a wide variety of causes to bring hope and happiness to less fortunate youth.

  Each Kids With A Cause program/event is dedicated to a specific cause which is determined by our youth members. They select causes that are important to them, such as:

    With the use of donated technology, students and disadvantaged youth capture their passion of helping. These photos and video segments are shared by all who visit our website to inspire others to do what they can to help. There is an annual contest and recognition  for creative and caring individuals who have demonstrated the projects they have created and made a difference. 

    We are seeking cash support to provide a memorable and meaningful awards ceremony and recognition for all who participated in "Capture Your Passion."  This type of acknowledgment can have a lasting impact as well as instill self-confidence and worth to those who are unable to live with their birth parents and reside in a group home. 

    The $1,000 grant will help our organization fund the event and help  brighten the lives of very deserving children.

    “Color Our World Beautiful” This program gives young children their own Kids With A Cause coloring books that are illustrated by celebrity youth from the Entertainment Industry. These special books are given to foster children as well as to children with developmental delays and/or learning challenges. The books are not just fun to color but also deliver very important messages about safety and good manners.

    

    Since the books have already been illustrated, the cash grant would be used for printing costs.  With $1,000 grant, approximately 500 books can be printed - - resulting in 500 smiles!

    “Create Your Cause”

    Students can help with our “Create Your Cause” program with two simple steps: 1. Select a cause to support 2. Create a fundraising or awareness project. For example, if helping to feed the hungry is your cause—you can create a food drive and deliver canned food to the local food bank. 

    Kids With A Cause will be proud to highlight your philanthropic activities on our website to encourage more students to participate and make a difference!

    You "CAN" Help By saving cans for recycling, you "CAN" help our Cause.  The money that is collected from a can collection drive can be sent as a donation that can be used to purchase special items, such as blankets, to help keep less fortunate children, living in homeless shelter, warm during the winter months.

  Hi! My name is Linda Finnegan and I love children!  I used to be a teacher and now I am the Founder and Executive Director of Kids With A Cause.  I feel very lucky to work with kids who, like you, want to help others.  You can visit our web site at www.kidswithacause.org to learn more about the work we do.  We were very fortunate to work with Common Cents in 2005 and I hope that we can continue to work together and help even more kids in the future!  Thank you for helping us, help children in need.
