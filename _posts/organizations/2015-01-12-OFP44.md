  Black Girls Rock wants all girls to be happy and healthy.  But when music videos, movies and magazines show women in a negative way, it can hurt young girls and their self-esteem.  Black Girls Rock encourages people to think and talk about this issue and helps young girls by introducing them to positive role models to be their mentors.   

  Black Girls Rock was started by a woman DJ and fashion model named Beverly Bond.  Beverly has performed for Prince, Jay-Z, Diddy, Britney Spears, Martha Stewart, and Michael Jordan.  She is proud to be a positive role model for the young girls in the Black Girls Rock mentoring program, and teaches them how to deejay at the Scratch DJ Academy in Manhattan.

    Black Girls Rock cares about what young people think.  Every year, the organization holds a panel discussion in the community and invites concerned citizens to come and talk about the ways women and girls are represented in music, television and magazines and other media.  Students can participate in this community forum as an advocacy service-learning project.  By speaking up, sharing their feelings and asking smart questions, students can play a very important role in society.

  My name is Akira and I have been a volunteer with Black Girls Rock for 2 years.  While I haven't worked with a Penny Harvest school yet, I'm looking forward to meeting young people who enjoy helping others as much as I do!
