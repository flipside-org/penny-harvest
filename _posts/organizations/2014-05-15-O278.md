mission: |
  Chromosome 22 Central is a non-profit organization and registered charity in Canada, and a Corporation with non-profit status in the USA. Our group is run solely by volunteers. We do not receive any grants or financial assistance, other than the generosity of our members. When a new family contacts us, we provide them with current information, offer support and connect them with others who thought they "were the only ones". We host annual events so families have the unique opportunity of meeting one another. And we spend a fortune in postage!
