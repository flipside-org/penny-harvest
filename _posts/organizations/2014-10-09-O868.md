mission: |
  Safe Place provides access to immediate help and safety for all young people in crisis. A network of thousands of businesses and other public locations across the country extend the doors of local youth serving agencies by displaying Safe Place's recognizable yellow and black diamond-shaped logo.

  

  The National Safe Place vision is to make the Safe Place sign the universal symbol of help and safety for youth by working with local communities to build safety nets that can prevent vulnerable children and teens from victimization.
