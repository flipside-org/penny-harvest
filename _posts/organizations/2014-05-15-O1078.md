   The Ronald McDonald House of Houston is a home away from home for the families of children undergoing treatment for cancer or other serious illnesses at hospitals.Each year, thousands of children travel to be treated for serious illnesses. For their families, anxiety over the child's illness is often compounded by lengthy hospital stays, months of outpatient treatment, and the expense of being away from home.
