mission: |
  Children’s Heaven is a non-profit organization whose mission is to embrace and empower the precious orphaned girls entrusted to our care in an effort to minimize their socioeconomic vulnerability. In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Children’s Heaven currently supports more than 80 girls through an innovative community placement and sponsorship program and has over 200 girls on a waiting list to enter. Through the provision of essential services along with the necessary skills and knowledge, we hope to see all of our girls lead healthy and productive lives.
