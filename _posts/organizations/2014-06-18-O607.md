mission: |
  Expanding on traditional improvisation practices, using drama as a teaching and learning tool, IDEAS strives to bring dramatic arts as a way of education for youth with disabilities and other disadvantages. Participants in IDEASâ€™ programs have the opportunity to creatively experience a variety of situations through the theater technique of improvisation. They respond to themes through characters they create, with props and costumes at hand. All activities emphasize respect and cooperation and are a catalyst for personal growth, development and learning.
