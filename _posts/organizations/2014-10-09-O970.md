mission: |
  Pets of the Homeless is a nonprofit all volunteer organization that provides pet food and veterinary care to the homeless and less fortunate in local communities across the United States and Canada. 

  We award grants to veterinarians that go to where the homeless congregate and provide veterinary care such as vaccines, spay/neuter and other needed treatments.  We award grants to homeless shelters that will allow pets sanctuary with their owners.
