  www.facebook.com/childrenofpromisenyc Children of Promise, NYC (CPNYC) provides services to children who have a parent in prison or jail. Our agency is located in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, which is a neighborhood where a lot of kids have a parent in prison. We have an after-school program, a summer camp, a mentoring program and counseling services for all of the children. There are over 200 kids in our program, every year, and they get tutoring, homework help, sports, dance, art and trips. The kids have a lot of fun but more importantly, they get love, support and positive attention from adults who really care about them.  All of the children at CPNYC have had very difficult life experiences and we help them to feel better, to do well in school and to believe in themselves.

    Children of Promise, NYC is buying a large van so that we can arrange for our children to take trips to visit their parents in prison.  The prisons are far away from NYC and the drive can be very long. Cash grants can help support this program by providing money for us to buy games, books, toys and movies to help make the long bus ride more fun.

    Children of Promise, NYC has a small computer lab that our children use for homework help, tutoring and for fun, but the lab room needs to be fixed up and it needs better computers.  Cash grants for this project can help us to buy new furniture, rugs, and to pay for a few new laptop computers and printers.

  Hi, my name is Sharon Content and I am the founder and President of Children of Promise, NYC. I started the organization 4 years ago because I learned that kids that have a parent in prison need special care and support and that most times, they don't get it. The children in our program have a lot of hurt feelings and painful emotions about their parent who is in prison and sometimes they have a very hard time in school. At CPNYC, we give kids the help they need to deal with their emotions so they can do really well in school and at home.
