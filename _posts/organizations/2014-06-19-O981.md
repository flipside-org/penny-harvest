mission: |
  The mission of the PAL Wynn Center is to significantly, enthusiastically and passionately create opportunities that allow the children of the Bedford Stuyvesant community to put the values of education into practice, thereby developing their self worth and community.

  

  Our vision is to cultivate an environment of Wynners through programming that encourages teamwork, commitment, discipline, persistence, focus, determination and personal achievement. Through enriching programs, children are always encouraged to think critically and find a positive outcome to difficult situations. Children constantly write, apply math skills, verbal, and reading to complete projects and solve personal conflicts.
