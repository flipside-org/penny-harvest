  Have you ever felt scared that someone would hurt you? Imagine feeling that every day. Some children feel unsafe because their parents hit them or say very mean things to them. Serenity House, operated by the African American Planning Commission, is committed to providing a safe, secret place for children and their moms or children and their dads, when they have to leave home because they are being hit or verbally abused by another adult in the house. Some of the services we provide are: counseling services, making sure the children continue to go to school, helping families find a new place to live permanently away from the abusive parent, helping them make sure they have enough food to eat, and we also provide activities for teenagers, young boys and girls, as well as babies.

    We would greatly appreciate your help with our fund raising efforts. We are trying to raise $20,000 to pay for architectural services so that our new building design can be completed on time. The City of New York has promised to give us a grant of $30 million to build the 70 unit apartment building but we must raise the architectural fees by ourselves. Once our architect has finished designing the building, it can take up to one and a half years to complete the construction.

  Hello, my name is Mr. Matthew Okebiyi. I am the Founder and Executive Director of the African American Planning Commission. I work with homeless families and children who being abused by a parent. My organization currently operates the largest domestic violence shelter in Brooklyn, but many of the people who live in the shelter come from all over New York City. 

  My organization is now in the process of building a very large apartment building in Brooklyn for seniors, single men and women and families who are very sick and are living with HIV and AIDS. Many of the children in the building may also be very sick and have HIV and AIDS. My organization plans to take care of everyone who will be living in the building by providing them with a safe, clean home in which to live, help them make new friends, and continue to go to school.

  

  I love what I do because it allows me to help people and make a difference in their lives. I have learned so much about homelessness, domestic violence and HIV/AIDS from both the children residing in our shelter and from their parents. I enjoy educating students about the mission of my organization and what we do. I welcome you to ask me any question you have or explain anything you do not quite understand.
