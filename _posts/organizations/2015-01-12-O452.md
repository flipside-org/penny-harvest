mission: |
  Since 1991, Friends has helped transform many thousands of lives through our programs and services. We provide emotional support for anyone with a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, cancer or other life-threatening physical illnesses... their family, friends, and caregivers... and anyone dealing with grief and bereavement. And we run a major HIV prevention program for teens in NYC public schools.
