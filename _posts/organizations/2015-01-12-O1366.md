mission: |
  Urban Arts Partnership advances the intellectual, social and artistic development of underserved public school students through arts-integrated education programs to close the achievement gap.  Urban Arts Partnership accomplishes its mission through a variety of interdisciplinary arts programs that include in-school classroom integration, after-school programs, master classes, professional development, summer programs, arts festivals, and special projects. The organization provides student-centered arts instruction in filmmaking, digital music production, photography, visual arts, theatre, design, dance, and language arts.  Presented in schools, at festivals, during community events, online, and in televised features, our studentsâ€™ final projects are consistently high quality and have garnered competitive, national awards while giving voice to countless stories from across the city
