mission: |
  Soaringwords' mission is to empower communities to embrace ill children and families and inspire them to "never give up!" Doctors and hospitals provide medical care, while Soaringwords provides in-person and online support that boosts self-esteem and helps reduce isolation. These fun, creative and educational healing activities include: story telling, poetry, art, songs, photography. Soaringwords enlists the help of schools, community outreach centers and businesses to create meaningful experiences for chronically ill children. We embrace communities in public and private schools, community centers such as the Boys & Girls Clubs, JCCs and YMCAs, churches and synagogues, special-needs schools and after-school programs where children, families and seniors come together to do something positive to inspire ill children to "never give up!"
