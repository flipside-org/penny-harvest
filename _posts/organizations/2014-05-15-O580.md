  HFHF believes in helping Haiti help Haiti. The Foundationâ€™s work impacts individual Haitians, consequently empowering them to act and change their own nation. We are equipping a new generation with a vision and the skills to make the dream a reality. Already, there are native Haitians making a difference as nurses, ministers, and teachers. The future undoubtedly holds influencers in law, politics, community organization, media and more.
