mission: |
  The Midnight Run is a consortium of more than one hundred churches, synagogues, and schools in the metropolitan area. Three or four nights a week, volunteers travel into Manhattan; there they seek out the homeless poor. They deliver clothing, food, blankets, and personal care items. In the process, they try to break through the barriers of prejudice and fear that try to separate us into artificial categories of "homed" and "homeless". Midnight Run is not a practical solution to the problem of homelessness and we don't claim it to be one. Instead, it operates on the premise that we all need to be better educated in order for real solutions to emerge. For a consensus to develop around answers to the tragedy of homeless people, those of us who are housed and those of us who are not must find common ground.
