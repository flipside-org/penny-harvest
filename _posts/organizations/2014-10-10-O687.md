mission: |
  A few years ago, one family that had adopted their child from Russia felt a call to give back. They had seen the orphanages first hand and they wanted to find a way to help all the children they had to leave behind. Their act of kindness became the KidsFirst Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on providing better lives for orphaned children around world. Today, funds raised by the Foundation go to work to help meet basic humanitarian needs and provide a network of support for families of adopted children.
