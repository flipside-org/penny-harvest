mission: |
  Founded in 1875, The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NYSPCC) is the first child protective agency in the world. Throughout its 131 year history, the NYSPCC has sought, through the development of new and innovative programs, to meet the urgent needs of New York Cityâ€™s most vulnerable children. It is with this same spirit of innovation, concern and compassion that the NYSPCC continually strives to fulfill its mission of protecting children and strengthening families through mental health, legal and educational services.
