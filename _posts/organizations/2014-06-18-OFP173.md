    The New York Cares Coat Drive: Dec 1st - Dec 31st

    Each December, New York Cares collects nearly 90,000 gently used winter coats and distributes them to thousands of men, women, and children who would otherwise go without. You can help by organizing your own coat drive and inspiring your family, teachers, and fellow students to give the gift of warmth. Set up a collection site in your school—wherever you choose—and run a coat drive of your own. New York Cares will supply you with posters to promote your collection. All we ask is that you provide the coat collection containers and deliver the coats to our Manhattan warehouse.

  I help raise money for New York Cares so that we can grow our programs by hiring more staff to create additional projects and deploy more volunteers out in the community. I've been working here for 7-years and have done everything from providing local soup kitchens with a steady stream of volunteers, to making it possible for volunteers to send holiday gifts to families who need them, to what I do now - raise money so that New York Cares continues to make it possible for people to volunteer at the places that need help most.
