  CancerCare is a national nonprofit that provides free help to anyone affected by cancer: people with cancer, caregivers, children, loved ones, and the bereaved. 

  When someone in a child's family has cancer, they can feel ignored because the person with cancer needs so much attention. They have to go to the doctor, get medicine, or spend time in the hospital.  So the child who is NOT sick may feel bad, because they are being ignored, but then they feel BAD for that feeling because they aren’t sick.  That’s why people can come to CancerCare and talk, or do crafts and activities to help them say to people they love – hey, I feel bad and I am scared and here’s why…

  

  CancerCare programs including counseling from social workers, education, financial assistance, and practical help. All of CancerCare's programs are free of charge. Founded in 1944, CancerCare now provides individual help to more than million people each year.

  Hi, my name is Rebecca.  I help raise money for CancerCare's programs like CancerCare for Kids.  I get to work and talk with people who have been helped by our organization, which always makes me feel good.  I've worked at CancerCare since March 2012.  Before I got here CancerCare had already been working with Common Cents schools for a few years.  We are so grateful to have had their support, and we hope to continue our relationships with them.
