  For over 50 years, LSA Family Health Service has been quietly helping transform the lives of poor New York families in East Harlem by doing whatever is necessary: counseling abused mothers, offering food to the hungry, providing one-on-one tutoring to children of immigrants, or ensuring a family has proper health care.  Established in East Harlem in 1958, LSA continues to be an integral part of the community and is the organization that thousands of families turn to for help.  LSA is a non-

  denominational community-based organization and is not supported by the Archdiocese.  LSA offers a range of health care and social services, education, advocacy and crisis counseling.  No family or individual is ever turned away because of an inability to pay.  LSA’s model, interdisciplinary approach combines the professional services of nurses, social workers, educators, child development specialists and lay advocates.

  
mission: |
  The Little Sisters of the Assumption Family Health Service has offered community-based health services to impoverished East Harlem families since 1958. The target population is child-bearing families with children at risk for developmental delays, abuse, and/or neglect. Programs focus especially on early-intervention and education, with an array of services made available to families in their own homes and at our center.
