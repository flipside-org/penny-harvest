  Rockaway Youth Task Force is an organization founded and run by the Rockaway Youth. We involve the youth in the area to play a positive role in making our community a better place to live and work. One of our biggest goals is to get Rockaway youth more involved in the community by encouraging community involvement. We volunteer at local community centers, hospitals and nursing homes. After Hurricane Sandy hit the NY area, Rockaway residents were badly effected. For several weeks, many residents had no electricity, heat, or access to food and water. The Rockaway Youth Task Force quickly gathers its members to setup a drop off location. We then went out to buildings and homes giving food, water and other essentials to local residents that were unable to get these items.
mission: |
  The mission of the Rockaway Youth Task Force is to empower youth in our local communities through civic engagement & volunteer opportunities. We seek to spark social change in the Rockaways through youth leadership and provide opportunities for teenagers and young adults to become productive citizens of the Rockaways. 

  We seek to educate ourselves and our peers through our four pillars: personal advancement, mentoring, volunteer work, and political and civic engagement.

    RYTF will be having a art project soon. This will allow for youth with an interest in art to participate and show their talents. We also hold regular block cleaning projects that involved having the youth in our community do clean ups. We have plans to also start a teen health project which will educate the youth on how to live a healthier lifestyle by eating a healthy and balanced diet. We would like to hire a nutrition to be able to talk to youth about healthy eating habits and lifestyle choices.

    We hold Resume Writing and Professional Development workshops for youth in Rockaway. These service help unemployed youth get back on their feet and source proper employment. We hope to expand these services in the future by partnering directly with local schools in order to work with more youth.

  My name is Abisoye Oloruntoba. Most people call me Soye for short. I have been a member of RYTF since Feb 2013. I currently serve as the Treasurer - helping to manage the finances and funding of the organization. This will be my first time working with the Common Cents project. I am excited about this project because it is in line with the same principles that we hold dear at RYTF and that is the youth have a positive role to play in improving our communities.
