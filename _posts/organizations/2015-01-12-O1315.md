mission: |
  The Foundation actively studies the marine environment, off Long Island particularly marine mammal and sea turtle populations. This includes operating the New York State Stranding Program for these endangered and protected species, as well as environmental education programs designed to promote conservation and stewardship of these species and their environment.

  

  New York's waters show serious effects of man's activities resulting in a heavily stressed ecosystem. Aware of the importance this coastal area holds for marine life, from plankton to fish, birds and whales, we are concerned that these vital habitats are being destroyed.
