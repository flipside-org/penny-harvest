  Started 13 years ago, Rockaway Beach Special Athletics caters to people of all ages who have mental disabilities. Typically, it has a higher population of young kids who are from the neighborhood and surrounding schools. This program runs specifically on a school-year schedule. Their program offers a once a week meet up in an auditorium where different types of athletic activities are offered. Throughout the year, various outside trips are planned such as going to baseball games, skiing, and kayaking. These trips vary year-to-year.
