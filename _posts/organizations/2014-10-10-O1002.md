mission: |
  Project Smile is federally tax exempt non-profit organization which donates stuffed animals, coloring books/crayons, small toys and children's reading books to police and fire departments for police officers, fire fighters and paramedics to give to children involved in traumatic situations. Project Smile has recently launched the Operation Elder Care program which provides stuffed animals to elderly people who are making the difficult and frequently traumatic transition to life in a nursing home. Established in November 2003, Project Smile was founded by Catherine Pisacane.
