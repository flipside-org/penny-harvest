mission: |
  Save-A-Pet Animal Rescue was founded in 1994 in Port Jefferson Station, Long Island. Our concern for the devastatingly large surplus of domestic animals sowed the seeds for our ever growing shelter. Under the direction of founder/president Dori Scofield, the dedicated staff, volunteers and team of veterinarians have made Save-A-Pet a safe harbor for companion animals.
