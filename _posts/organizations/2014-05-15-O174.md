mission: |
  The BAC is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) school serving children with special needs. We are located in the historic Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, one subway stop from Manhattan, and steps from the Brooklyn Bridge.

  

  Our program is founded by parents, educators and community activists who are determined to provide high quality, effective educational services for children that need 1:1 support. Our philosophy is grounded in data-based scientific research, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), which is the educational standard and best practice for children on the Autism Spectrum.
