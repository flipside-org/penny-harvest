  Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center, located in the East Flatbush section of Central Brooklyn, was founded in 1925 as a chronic care facility to serve the then Jewish Community within a cultural context. As the community has evolved and diversified, Kingsbrook has expanded its services and programs, to meet the needs of the large culturally diverse communities that it now serves.
