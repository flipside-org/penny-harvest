  The Olivia Boccuzzi Foundation was founded in honor of Olivia Marie, a courageous, smart, beautiful and spunky little girl who was nearly 3 when she lost her 11-month battle with a PNET brainstem tumor, a form of childhood cancer. Our foundation is dedicated to honoring Oliviaâ€™s memory by providing funds to world-renowned hospitals and scientists actively researching cures for pediatric brain tumors.
