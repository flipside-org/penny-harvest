mission: |
  American Recreational Military Services (A.R.M.S.) was founded in 2003 by a group of grass roots volunteers who wanted to give something back to the military and their families. In a matter of months, this small organization had grown from just a handful to more than 325 volunteers throughout the tri-state area.  A.R.M.S. supports the area unit Family Readiness Groups, as well as providing direct assistance to family members in need. In addition, A.R.M.S. has been working with the local military bases to address quality of life issues for soldiers and their families. A.R.M.S. first effort was directed in soliciting donations to be packed in boxes and shipped to the troops overseas. A.R.M.S.' goal for this year is to provide a care package for every tri-state area service member.
