  Prevent Child Abuse America has been working, since 1972, to prevent child abuse and neglect from ever happening in our country.  We do research to see which prevention methods actually work, and then we share what we know with people all over the country.  We also educate policy-makers, such as senators, congressmen, and the president, about what policies will protect children.  We have a direct service program, Healthy Families America, which provides support to families with young children.  With extra support, parents are less likely to take stress out on their kids.  We hope our efforts will eventually make child abuse and neglect something that just doesn't happen, ever, in our country.  We hope you will support us in this great cause!

  My name is Mallory Schiesher.  I have been working for Prevent Child Abuse America for just over 1 year, and I'm so excited that I am able to inform communities about something  so important -- making sure all children have the best opportunity to lead healthy, happy lives.
