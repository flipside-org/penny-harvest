description: 
mission: |
  The Garden City Park Civic Association was formed in 1965, with the purpose of promoting civic pride and protecting the interests of property owners in the community. Garden City Park has changed since then, and so has the Garden City Park Civic Association.

  Our mission is still to promote civic pride and to protect the interest of property owners, but it is much more than that. Quality of life, safety and a voice for our community in local government are some of the issues the "new" Garden City Park Civic Association will be addressing. We plan on working with local government, law enforcement and local businesses to make Garden City Park an even better place to live.
