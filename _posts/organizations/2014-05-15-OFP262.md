  Seamen’s Society for Children and Families is Staten Island’s oldest charity.  It was founded in 1846 to serve the children of poor seamen; the Society today serves children and families of all backgrounds and faiths. Last year it provided services for over 700 children in Staten Island and Brooklyn and reaches over 2,000 children on Staten Island with its youth services program.

  

  Our mission is to provide services to protect children from harm and to help rebuild families.  Below are a few of the programs that help us to serve the children and families in our community. 

  Foster Care and Adoption cares for abused and neglected children until they can safely return home.  Sometimes these children are unable to return home and our Adoption Services will provide them with a permanent home.

  

  Day Care is provided for children between the ages of 2 months and 4 years during daytime hours on Staten Island while their parents are at work or school.

  

  Preventive Services works to keep families together by keeping children out of foster care on Staten Island and in Brooklyn.

  

  Family Treatment/Rehabilitation Program work to keep families together when a parent or child has a substance abuse problem.

  

  Domestic Violence Intervention povides families assistance where domestic violence is occurring.

  

  Forward through Education provides free after school tutoring services to agency children and chldren in the community from elementary to high school.

  

  English as a Second Language program provides assistance to those that have difficulty within the community because English is not their first language.

  

  Our Scholarship Program helps teens on Staten Island and in Brooklyn who are involved with any program of Seamen’s to attend college or vocational school after graduating from high school.
mission: |
  Founded in 1846 as the Society for the Relief of Destitute Children of Seamen, the agency's original mission was to care for the children and widows of sailors who were killed at sea. Today, Seamen's Society for Children and Families is a comprehensive social service agency serving over 7,500 children and families in Staten Island and Brooklyn.

    Seamen’s Society is asking you to support our foster children who are removed from their homes because their parents are unable to take care of them in a safe manner.  Many of these children are placed with relatives but often with total strangers who serve as their foster parents. When the children are moved from home to home, they often move without their belongings. A grant of $750 would enable us to buy 50 comfort bags at $15.00 each and fill them with a soft blanket, book, and toy to distribute amongst our most needy children.

    Many of our children have never celebrated their birthdays; some have never received a birthday card, which we all take for granted.  We do not want our children to feel forgotten.  A grant of $500.00 would enable us to buy birthday cards, envelopes and postage to send out and put a smile on a child’s face. There are also opportunities to sponsor monthly birthday parties for $200 that includes pizza, drinks, cupcakes and craft activity.

    Many of the youth that come into our drop-in center need to freshen up. A collection of health care items such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, deodorant, and hand cream can be very helpful.  For more information, please contact me.

    We have a holiday toy drive every year for over 1,000 children in our programs on Staten Island and in Brooklyn.  We try to give every child in our programs a gift for the holidays.  For more information, please contact me.

  Hi!  My name is Christine Marino. I am the new Development Officer at Seamen's.  I have been working for Seamen’s since January 2009 and I love my job. For the last 14 years, I worked for the largest youth organization in the city. I worked with children and adults in the education field as well as going out in the community and raising money.  My job today is similar as I am responsible for going out in the community and telling people about the Society and the good things that we do as well as raising money through special events.  I know that for the past few years Seamen’s has been very fortunate in receiving support from Common Cents and the Penny Harvest for our projects and for putting smiles on the faces of the children in our care for which I thank you. I look forward to speaking with you when you call.
