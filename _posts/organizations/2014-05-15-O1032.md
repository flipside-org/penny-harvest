mission: |
  In 1980, as economics made it more and more difficult to turn a profit in touring puppet theatre, Mr. Coppola founded the not-for-profit company, Puppetworks, Inc. which eventually replaced the Nicolo Marionettes.

   In addition to operating its full-time resident puppet theatre in Brooklyn's Park Slope historic district, Puppetworks has been a holiday tradition at Macy*s (Herald Square) since Macy*s built a puppet theatre especially for Puppetworks in 1976.

  

  From 1997 to 2000, Puppetworks presented productions at the Children's Aid Society's Greenwich Village Center Theatre.  In concert, Puppetworks has appeared with the Little Orchestra Society, St. Lukes' Chamber Ensemble, the Orchestra da Camera and the Brooklyn Philharmonic in such works as Debussy's "Toy Box," Ibert's "Divertissements," and in highly-praised performances of Haydn's marionette opera
