  To improve the quality of life for individuals with autism by empowering parents, caregivers, advocates and professionals acting on their behalf.  By offering extensive information,  the Elija Foundation is  able to assist parents and others to participate actively and with knowledge in the individualâ€™s educational and intervention services.  The Elija Foundation is also committed to providing support for addressing the social and emotional needs of family members who have been touched by autism.  Our goal is to keep our community in the forefront of educational and intervention services that focus on making a socially significant impact in the lives of those with autism.
