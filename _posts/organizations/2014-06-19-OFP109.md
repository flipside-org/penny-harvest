  Have you ever wondered what you can do to make New York City a healthier environment to live in?  GrowNYC needs kids like you to help recycle, plant, educate, and eat healthy everyday.  Every penny helps make New York City a greener place.  This summer GrowNYC worked with students to help teach them about growing vegetables and eating healthy.  The students planted vegetables in gardens, once the vegetables grew big they learned how to cook and eat them healthy.  The students then went on and taught others all about this great experience.  This is one of the many improvements that happen every day here at GrowNYC.

    Your Pennies can also go towards Hurricane Sandy victims by helping GrowNYC to buy regionally-grown wholesale produce from Greenmarket and Greenmarket Co. farmers to deliver directly to carefully chosen community kitchens and pantries that are preparing hot meals for those directly affected by Hurricane Sandy.  GrowNYC was affected by losing the Grow Truck, gardens being destroyed and some markets were shut down for weeks.
