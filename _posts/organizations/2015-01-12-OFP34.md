  Autism Speaks focuses on four main areas: Science, Awareness, Family Services and Advocacy.  On the science side, we fund autism research with the goal of finding more information on autism.  To spread awareness, we promote acceptance of people with autism and try to make others more aware of how autism affects people.  To help families and individuals who are affected by autism, we provide them with information about autism and point them in the right direction when they need help.  As for advocacy, we work with the government to ensure laws are passed that will help families affected by autism.
