description: 
mission: |
  Fields of Growth International is a charitable organization with community based partnerships in Uganda, East Africa. Our organization was founded with the belief that we were put on this earth to share our passion, joy and gifts with the less fortunate. Fields of Growth is about more than sharing the game of lacrosse, but lacrosse is a key component in our mission, because our organization believes in the power of passion and enthusiasm. We believe that when you share the things that bring you the most joy that you are doing exactly what God created you to do and thatâ€™s a great feeling.
