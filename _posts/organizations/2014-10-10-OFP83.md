    We have a food pantry so donations can be made there.  We also have a meals program (soup kitchen) that feeds people lunches six days a week and money can go to supply food in the Lunch Box as well.  $135.00 will provide 100 meals.

    Cash can also be used by our Emergency Assistance Program that helps people keep their utilities on when they have temporary short falls in income.  It also helps pay for needed prescriptions, rent and other basic necessities.

  I was hired to help develop a database containing the names of our donors and to be a fundraiser for the organization.  I worked part time - as do half of our staff members.  I've worked here for 2 and a half years.
