  Court Appointend Special Advocates: The mission of the National Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Association, together with its state and local members, is to support and promote court-appointed volunteer advocacy so that every abused or neglected child can be safe, establish permanence and have the opportunity to thrive.

  

  National CASA and our network of over 1,050 local community program offices support volunteers serving children. The role of local CASA programs is to recruit, train and support volunteers in their work with abused children.
