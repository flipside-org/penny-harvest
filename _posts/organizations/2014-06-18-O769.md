mission: |
  Make the Road by Walking is a not-for-profit, membership-led organization based in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Our members are primarily low-income Latino and African-American residents of Bushwick and surrounding neighborhoods. Working within these economically marginalized neighborhoods, Make the Road by Walking fights for justice and opportunity through community organizing on issues of concern to our multi-generational membership. We promote economic justice and participatory democracy by increasing residents power to achieve self-determination through collective action.
