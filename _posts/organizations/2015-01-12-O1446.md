mission: |
  You Gotta Believe!, The Older Child Adoption and Permanency Movement, Inc. is an IRS determined 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation and was approved by the State of New York to have the authority to both place out and board out children since 1995.  We are a homeless prevention program that seeks to prevent homelessness by finding permanent moral and legal adoptive homes for teens and preteen children in foster care. We offer an on-going learning experience to the general public offering our nine-week Adopting Older Kids And Youth (A-OKAY) parent preparation course four times during the week.
