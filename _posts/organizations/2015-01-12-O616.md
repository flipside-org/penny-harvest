  Independence Residences, Incorporated (IRI) is a not-for-profit human service agency, committed to supporting the highest quality of life for adults with developmental disabilities, visual and other impairments, by providing innovative residential and community support services. This commitment is rooted in integrity, growing as a supportive extended family: starting with our consumers and the talented men and women who comprise our agency staff and Board; extending to our family partners, civic and professional; the communities where we live and work; and reaching all the way to the homes of the individuals who comprise our greater service family. IRI's mission begins with the dreams in the hearts of our consumers, is strengthened by their community of supporters and nurtured by IRI's ever-widening circle of supports, turning dreams into reality.
