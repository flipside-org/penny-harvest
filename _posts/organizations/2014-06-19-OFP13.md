  The American Cancer Society is the nationwide community-based voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives, and diminishing suffering from cancer through research, education, advocacy, and service. Providing the public with accurate, up-to-date information on cancer is a priority for the American Cancer Society.  The Society provides information on all aspects of cancer through a toll-free 24-hour information line, web site, and published materials.

  
mission: |
  The American Cancer Society has been waging war against cancer for nearly a century, and our commitment to defeating the disease has never wavered. Our lifesaving efforts are funded exclusively by the generosity of donors like you. Since 1993 Making Strides Against Breast Cancer® has raised more than $100 million in additional funding to support the Society’s breast cancer research, education, advocacy, and patient services.

  Hi! My name is Anna Genesin and I am a manager of special events. Although I've only been with the organization a few months, I'm excited about the great work that we do and I've seen the many benefits in my short time here. 

  I'm excited to work with students to come up with projects for service opportunities and tell them all about where the money that they donate goes!
