  We exist because we think that taking care of our shared resources is crucial to helping others. We all need air, water, shelter and food to survive.  We want to make sure that our environment is safe enough and healthy enough for everyone to be well fed, sheltered, and healthy, so we teach new yorkers of all ages about the environment for free. We also have volunteer events for tree care, estuary stewardship, pollution prevention, and more.

    Tree Care Tuesdays:   Human Impacts Instituteâ€™s successful Tree Care Tuesday program will generally runs from April through September.  The goal of Tree Care Tuesdays is to beautify NYC neighborhoods, create community relationships, promote green space, mitigate air pollution, and prevent stormwater runoff.  Tree care sessions involve community volunteers, alongside HII crew cleaning-up, aerating and mulching tree beds and planting bulbs in the tree bed soil all while spending quality time with your community and mother nature.   Human Impacts Institute will provide supplies for tree care. Participants should bring water bottles, sunblock, a hat, and any other personal items. Participants under 18 need to be accompanied by a guardian.

  Tara founded the Human Impacts Institute in 2010, seeing a need for creative approaches to sustainability and global coalition building. Before starting the Human Impacts institute, Tara worked for 9 years as Director of Environmental Education and as Program Director for a NYC community-based organization--developing opportunities for inner-city youth to learn about, and develop responsibility for, their local environment.
