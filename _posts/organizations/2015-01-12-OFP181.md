  Hello! As the Executive Director of the NIA, I'm especially proud of the contributions our organization has made to improve the quality of life for the residents of Brooklyn that we serve. Since we offer only cost-free services, we rely on public and private grants to fund our quality after school programs, family counseling, and neighborhood initiatives that make life better for the communities we serve. We are also grateful for the contributions we have received over the years from the schools in our area that have provided us with funds through Common Cents. We look forward to continuing to offer children, youth and families cost-free programs and services that they would not otherwise have access to in our community without the help of local schools, elected officials and private donors.
