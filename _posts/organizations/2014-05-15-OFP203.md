  Our mission is to provide high-quality service dogs free-of-charge to disabled American veterans.  Service dogs can and do dramatically improve the quality of life for our servicemen and women who have sacrificed so much for our country.  These dogs help these veterans become more independent and enable them to lead happier, healthier lives.
mission: |
  The mission of Patriot PAWS is to train and provide service dogs of the highest quality at no cost to disabled American veterans and others with mobile disabilities in order to help restore their physical and emotional independence. Patriot PAWS intends to build partnerships with state and community organizations to help develop and support this goal.

cash_grants: yes
grants: 
  - |
    All donated money received by Patriot PAWS is put towards obtaining new puppies, buying supplies for the dogs, and assisting veterans when they come to train with their new dog.  We always need office supplies, training supplies, medicines, vet bills paid, etc.  These costs vary from $5.00 all the way up to thousands of dollars.
  - |
    A vet bill can run $45 up to hundreds or even thousands.  Training supplies regularly cost hundreds of dollars every couple of months.  We must buy leashes and collars often and those cost $5.00 each for leashes and up to $8.00 for a good quality collar.  Heartworm prevention costs a good deal of money when you consider we have 42 dogs in training currently.

    We always welcome volunteers to donate their time to clean the facility, collect money, including coin drives, make cards for graduating veterans, bathe the dogs and puppies, and make food items for graduation day!

    There are many opportunities to help Patriot PAWS Service Dogs.  Students can write cards and letters for us to distribute to graduating veterans letting them know how much their service and sacrifice are appreciated.  They can also bring food for graduation day.  We welcome students who want to weed flower beds, bathe the dogs, or clean the training facility.  And always, we welcome students to think of new and creative ways to generate money!
