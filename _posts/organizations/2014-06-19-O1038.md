  In 1989 Queens College launched a pilot project with the goal of creating a model, which would ease the devastating effects of homelessness on children. A college student is paired with a youngster who is either homeless or otherwise "at risk, and together they spend every Saturday throughout the academic year participating in a wide variety of mutually chosen educational, cultural and recreational activities.
