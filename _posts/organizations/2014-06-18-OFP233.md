contact_person_intro: |
  I was always interested in working with people since high school when I was involved in a psychology club. There were no courses until I went to Binghamton University.  After graduating and having a life changing experience involving religion, I became a licensed clinical social worker now directing an interfaith agency that brings religion, spirituality and mental health together helping adults, children and families with everyday problems.  I also direct another agency that provides other services.  They work together to do the most to help everyone but sometimes this is difficult because of the lack of money, so interns and volunteers are vital to this work.
