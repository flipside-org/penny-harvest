  I have worked with The Good Dog Foundation for a year and every day I am touched by another story I hear of a dog reaching out to a child or adult helping them recover from an illness or learn to read!  You will be amazed what a difference a visit from a therapy dog can make to someone in a hosiptal, nursing home or school and how they look forward to visits from a Good Dog.
