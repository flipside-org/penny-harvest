  We are a senior center.  It's like a club for older people.  For Grandma's and Grandpa's.  We provide food and they socialize and have fun exercising and doing Yoga and Zumba! We try to keep them healthy and happy so that their families can enjoy them for a long time.  We also get them food stamps because lots of older people do not have enough food to eat. That's important.

  I am the manager of the center.  I have been with this center for 27 years. I love my job because it helps people who really need help with everyday problems. I have worked with common cents for 3 years because it really helps both the students and the seniors develop a real friendship.
