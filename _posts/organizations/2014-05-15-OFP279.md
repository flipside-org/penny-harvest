  The mission of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. No child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family's ability to pay. No family ever pays St. Jude for anything.
mission: |
  St. Jude researchers are published and cited more often in high impact publications than any other private pediatric oncology research institution in America. St. Jude is a place where many doctors send some of their sickest patients and toughest cases. A place where cutting-edge research and revolutionary discoveries happen every day. We've built America's second-largest health-care charity so the science never stops.

    While our patients and their families are at St. Jude, they can get their meals at our cafeteria that offers everything from breakfast to dessert.  We give our patients and families meal cards, so their food is provided for free.  $20 will buy a card for one meal for both a patient and a parent.

    Blood is made of different kinds of cells that do very important things, like fight infections.  When someone has cancer, they often need extra blood cells, which can be given to them by doctors.

    

    Plasma is the liquid that holds all the blood cells together - $65 per unit 

    Red blood cells make our blood red and carry oxygen to all the parts of the body - $245 per unit 

    Platelets make our blood clot to stop bleeding - $520 per unit

    There are so many ways to help the children of St. Jude, and many of these ways are in your own community. You can run a race, ride a bike or tricycle, attend a walk-a-thon, or even complete some math problems through St. Jude Math-A-Thon. No matter how you help, your support will make a difference in the lives of children suffering from cancer and other catastrophic diseases.  For information - www.stjude.org/volunteers
