  EIS helps New Yorkers stay put!  Every day EIS helps at least one New Yorker-maybe even one of your neighbors or classmates or a person like your grandma-stay in their homes.  Many times families fall behind in their rent-no one wants this to happen, no one plans this-but sometimes a parent or guardian gets sick or loses their job and it's hard to pay the bills.  EIS helps families pay their bills and stay in their homes.  If things get really bad we even have lawyers who will help the family get out of trouble with their landlord.  EIS does every thing we can do to make sure a family stays in their apartment and does not have to live in a homeless shelter.

    Housing Advocacy Program

    A $100.00 grant will provide 5 families with home visits from our housing advocate.  We can talk to the landlord and make sure the family is not thrown out.  A housing advocate will write letters and get $$$ to help pay back rent for the family.

  Hi!!  My name is Audrey and I work at EIS Housing Resource Center.  I like my job because at EIS we help people stay in their homes!  Everything we do is done to make sure people don't ever have to live in a shelter or beg for money on the street.  Do you live in a nice, safe apartment?  I do, too.  At EIS we want to make sure every family can live in a safe, nice home.  Wanna talk more about it?  Give me a call; let's meet.  So happy you're interested in the work we do and you care about the people we help.
