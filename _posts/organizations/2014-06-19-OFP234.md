    Through Rotunda Gallery in Residence!, specially trained artist teachers, all practicing artists with active studio practices and classroom experience, provide arts instruction at public schools over a minimum of eight weeks. Each residency is customized to complement the curriculum priorities of each school while addressing the needs and interests of the participating classroom. Residencies also incorporate ongoing professional development opportunities for participating classroom teachers to further strengthen BRIC Rotunda Gallery’s long-term impact on our school partners.

    

    Residency themes are based on a curriculum area selected by the classroom teacher and Artist Educator, such as biology, geography, math or social studies. Students explore these themes while learning about contemporary art, interacting with artists, and creating artwork in varied media. Residencies culminate in a large-scale, collaboratively-produced installation or project with community significance, such as a public mural or exhibition. This public showcase serves to reinforce instruction as students engage with their classroom teachers, parents, and peers. Not only does this strengthen student learning, but it provides a self-esteem building opportunity, empowering students to see themselves as creative thinkers and artists. Artwork from each partnership is included in KidsArt, an exhibition held at BRIC Rotunda Gallery each May and June.
