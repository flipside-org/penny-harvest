  We believe in the plan of salvation. God is so eager to establish a personal, loving relationship with you that He has already arranged for it to be possible. Now, He is waiting for you to respond to His invitation. You can receive His forgiveness for your sins and through faith in His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, receive assurance of eternal life.
