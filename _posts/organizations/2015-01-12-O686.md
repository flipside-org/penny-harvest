mission: |
  KEEN is modeled on an innovative program established in Oxford, England by Elliott Portnoy, who brought KEEN to the Washington, DC area in 1992. With help from a handful of parents and volunteers, KEEN started as a single program. Now, because of our careful attention to the needs of our athletes and their families, and our volunteers, KEEN serves hundreds of young people in the Greater DC area with disabilities and offers a wide range of programs and activities.
