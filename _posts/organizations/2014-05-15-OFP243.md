  Redemption Outreach Intl inc is a community based non-

  for profit organization. It was founded in 2002 as a focus group discussion in response to the problems and the needs of the poor, sick, weak, and less privileged. Recognizing that the New York minority community has a high rate of diseases and social problems, Redemption Outreach joined other organizations to reduce the spread of diseases and social problems. These diseases and social problems include STD, HIV/AIDS, teen pregnancy, high risk behavior and bullying.
