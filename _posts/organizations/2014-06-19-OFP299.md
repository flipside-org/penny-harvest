  The Fresh Air Fund sends children from New York City’s neediest communities on free summer vacations to summer camp and to stay with host families who live in the country.  We’ve been serving New York City kids since 1877 and have helped over 1 million kids get a break during summer!  Children can go stay with a host family for 2 weeks and do things like swimming, biking, and just enjoying the outdoors in a new place with new friends.  Our host families live in 13 states, from Maine to Virginia, and Southern Canada.  Children could also go to summer camp – we have five camps all in one location in Fishkill, NY.  Our programs are a lot of fun and give inner city kids a chance to do something really special during the summer!  For more information, please visit our website at www.freshair.org.

    It would be terrific if students would sponser a child to visit a Friendly Town host family for 2 weeks.  Children visit volunteer host families in 13 Northeastern states from Virginia to Maine and often make life-long friends!  It costs $920.00 to send a Fresh Air child to Friendly Town for two weeks.

It costs $1,579.00 to send a Fresh Air child to camp for two weeks.

  Hello, my name is Lori.  I am the Director of Development at The Fresh Air Fund.  We send New York City children in need on free two week summer vacations to the country! We have received several Common Cents grants in the past - it is so wonderful when children want to help less fortunate children in their communities!
