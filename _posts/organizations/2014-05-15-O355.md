mission: |
  If you or someone you love has diabetes, then you know that diabetes is a devastating disease that causes so much pain and suffering. You know that diabetes robs children of the freedom and innocence of childhood; that it takes lives prematurely; and that patients worry about their future as they try to manage diabetes every minute of every day. The one thing you dream about: a cure for diabetes.

  

  Thankfully, there are many charities and organizations devoted to the care of diabetes patients and the education of the public about diabetes. But there is only one national organization solely devoted to finding a cure for diabetes: the Diabetes Research Institute.
