  For over 60 years, the Children's Cancer & Blood Foundation (CCBF) has been helping children with cancer and blood disorders at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. We help to give children medicine at the hospital, even when they don't have enough money to pay for the medicine. We also help doctors find new medicine to make the children feel even better so they can have a very long life. Your support will help even more children get the medicine and care that they need.
