  DAMAYAN is a non-profit membership-based organization that serves low income immigrant workers.  We educate, organize and mobilize our community to fight for our rights and welfare.  We also address the root causes that drive millions of Filipinos to flee from poverty and economic crisis in the the Philippines.  DAMAYAN is a democratically run organization led by women domestic workers.  DAMAYAN is a Filipino word which means "helping each other."

  We work towards transforming society so that people have equal opportunities and are not forced to migrate to foreign countries to meet the basic needs for survival.  Damayan runs 4 core service programs: 1) labor program which enabled us to retrieve over $500,000 in stolen wages and help 7 trafficked domestic workers win T (trafficking) visas and T derivative visas for 6 family members, and counting. While the passage of the NY Domestic Workers Bill of Rights is historical, it has not effectively given protections and standards to domestic workers. Majority of women domestic workers still suffer from bad working conditions and lack of protection and trafficked domestic workers experience the most inhumane forms of labor exploitation, amounting to modern-day slavery. 2) LUNAS (heal) holistic health program because this service program is very important for domestic workers. Because of long hours of work, bad working conditions and unhealthy food in their workplace, Filipino domestic workers in the US suffer from high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar. 88% of them do not have health insurance. 3)  the gender rights program where we gives support to women domestic workers who have become victims of violence in their workplace or in their homes.  In this year, when immigration becomes the central issue facing undocumented immigrant workers, we are also creating an 4) immigration support program, Damayan also leads a flagship campaign against the labor trafficking of low wage workers, particularly domestic workers.

    DAMAYAN has a LUNAS Filipino Migrant Workers Holistic Health Program.  We provide educational literature and information about health rights of immigrants and connect workers to meet their health needs.  As part of the health program, we conduct health fairs every three months where participants are able to get immediate health screenings for blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, set appointments for women's health and have a valuable one-on-one doctor's consultation.

    

    All the health screening supplies and materials are purchased by the organization or donated by health professionals.  Cash grants of $1000 would provide for the health screening of 150 immigrant workers.  Almost all of the participants DAMAYAN gives services to do not have health insurance, experience severe physical hardship because of their work conditions and are high risk for hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart conditions and other health problems.

    DAMAYAN also serves the Filipino immigrant workers and empowers them to fight for their labor rights.  Many DAMAYAN members are domestic workers who are nannies, babysitters, house cleaners, cooks, baby nurses and elderly caregivers.  As domestic workers who have been excluded from many labor laws, majority of the community members experience violations in their basic human rights.  DAMAYAN has worked with workers who have been paid as little as 36 cents per hour and work as long as 110 hours a week.  In addition, workers experience racism and discrimination -- verbal abuse, harassment, belittling, physical assault and even sexual abuse.  

    DAMAYAN teaches workers to fight for basic rights and human dignity.  A $500 grant helps in paying for the printing and publishing of educational materials that can inform more than 1,000 individuals.  A $1,000 grant helps to organize three forums and house meetings where workers can be trained to learn and assert their labor, immigrant and women's rights.
