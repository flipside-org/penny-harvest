mission: |
  The Crown Heights Youth Collective was established in Brooklyn, New York in 1978 in response to the need to provide comprehensive services for disadvantaged youth. The Collective serves the diverse African and Hasidic communities of Crown Heights, and during the past 22 years have served more than 85,000 young people. With our unique hands on approach we meet the youth wherever they are; whether it is the playground, schoolroom or street corner. Although we continue to target youth aged 3-22 years old, our services are also available to the community-at-large. The "Collective" provides opportunities to all who really care about themselves and their neighbor to do something for the community.
