  Some babies are born with something wrong with their faces and we think that all these children should have the chance to get their deformities fixed! The Little Baby Face Foundation provides free corrective plastic surgery for children born with facial deformities. We bring children from all over the world and the U.S. to NYC for evaluation and treatment. Contact me to find out how your pennies can help these kids!

  The Little Baby Face Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to address the needs of children with facial deformities. The foundation's primary focuses are corrective surgery for infants and children; support services for families; education for medical practitioners, families and the general public; and support for related research.

    While staying in NYC for surgery, patients and their parents and/or guardians require money for their personal expenses (food, transportation, metro cards, phone cards, laundry, etc.). These expenses can run $500 to $750. We are very grateful for donations to support any portion of these needs.

    You can also help pay for a child's prescriptions and surgical supplies which can cost between $500 to $1,000.  We are also grateful for contributions in the amount of $500-$1,500 to help pay for airfare for those children who don't live in NYC.

  Hi!  My name is Fran and I am very fortunate to be working with the Little Baby Face Foundation. It is very rewarding to be a part of the Foundation's good works, which bring such a transformation to the lives of so many children who are born with facial deformities.  We are very grateful because so far this year, we've received Penny Harvest grants from so many schools in all 5 boroughs. All these pennies have allowed us to help more children look better, feel better about themselves and maybe even hear when they couldn't before through plastic surgery to correct their birth defects.
