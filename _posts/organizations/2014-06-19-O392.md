description: 
mission: |
  Environmental Defense is dedicated to protecting the environmental rights of all people, including future generations. Among these rights are clean air, clean water, healthy food and flourishing ecosystems. We are guided by scientific evaluation of environmental problems, and the solutions we advocate will be based on science, even when it leads in unfamiliar directions. We work to create solutions that win lasting economic and social support because they are nonpartisan, cost-effective and fair. We recognize that low-income communities and communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to many environmental threats, and we seek answers that are equitable and just for all.
