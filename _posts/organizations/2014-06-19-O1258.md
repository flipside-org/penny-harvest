  SUNN is a nonprofit community organization working to create a better, more harmonious Sunnyside through activities such as graffiti-removal, crime prevention and neighborhood beautification. We work closely with the police, residents, businesses, religious organizations and government officials. Our catchment area extends from 39th to 52nd Streets, and from Barnett Avenue to Queens Blvd.
