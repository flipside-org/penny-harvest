  Literacy Inc. (LINC) addresses the crisis in literacy facing children living in poverty in New York City. Early childhood programs, family involvement and community support are crucial to developing strong literacy skills which are generally lacking for children growing up in poverty. To combat this problem, LINC developed its Comprehensive Literacy Model, based on research showing that mobilizing three key constituency groups – peers, parents and community members – has a demonstrated impact on early childhood literacy development. Using community based coordinators, LINC works with schools, families, libraries, local businesses, and community partners to create a sustained, coordinated, community-based effort to promote literacy skills for at-risk youth.
mission: |
  In LINC's vision, every child is reading well by age eight, and the strengths and resources of every community are coordinated to provide encouraging voices and a language-rich atmosphere that supports early readers.

  LINC is based on two firm beliefs: Every child can read on time with enough one-on-one support. Every community has significant strengths and resources that can be coordinated to provide this support. LINC's purpose is to develop a proven system of outreach and coordination of community resources that enables neighborhoods to support all young children as readers. Over time, LINC seeks to adapt the system so as to assist any community that aims to bring together its resources on behalf of early literacy.

    The LINC Reading Partner Program, which is the anchor program in the schools, pairs older students (tutors) with younger students (tutees) for one-on-one reading time. LINC provides training, materials and activities as well as ongoing assessments for this structured partnered reading program, which takes place during school, once a week throughout the school year. This program is designed to give students invaluable one-on-one reading time through a positive long-term and supportive relationship.  LINC also provides reading partner programs in community center after school programs. A grant of $1,000 could provide 50 high quality books as well as the necessary materials for the reading activities and trainings (printing of reading journals, surveys, etc.).

  Hello, my name is Sierra Bush. I am the Operations Manager at Literacy Inc. I am responsible for taking care of general office duties such as answering the phones and ordering supplies. I also help LINC raise money since we are a non-profit organization.  I've been working with LINC for a short time, but hope to help expand the programs we've started all over the city. LINC was fortunate to receive our first Common Cents contribution from P.S. 315. That contribution greatly helped the Reading Partner Program we currently have there. We hope that the Penny Harvest will help us bring even more resources to more schools across New York City.
