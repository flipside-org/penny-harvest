  Hi, my name is Maxine Harrison-Gallmon.  I've been the food coordinator at Bethesda for over 3 years (Sept. 2005).  I've held many jobs in the past, but this one has been the most rewarding.  I truly feel that I am making a difference.  The reward we received from Penny Harvest last year was desperately needed and appreciated.
