mission: |
  The Melissa K. Bambino Melanoma Foundation has been established by Melissa’s family and friends to honor her memory... and to help eliminate this devastating and preventable disease.

  

  Our mission is simple:

  Research. Awareness. Prevention.

  

  Our primary fundraising vehicle is an annual Sun Run™. This event is a 5K run / walk that is open to adults and children. It promotes sun safety as well as the importance of an annual skin exam. Proceeds from each run go to Melanoma research and awareness.
