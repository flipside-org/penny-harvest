mission: |
  The Red Hook Community Justice Center is the nation's first multi-jurisdictional community court. It seeks seeks to solve neighborhood problems like drugs, crime, domestic violence and landlord-tenant disputes. At Red Hook, a single judge hears neighborhood cases that under ordinary circumstances would go to three different courts—Civil, Family and Criminal. The goal is to offer a coordinated, rather than piecemeal, approach to people's problems. The Red Hook judge has an array of sanctions and services at his disposal, including community restitution projects, on-site educational workshops and GED classes, drug treatment and mental health counseling—all rigorously monitored to ensure accountability and drive home notions of individual responsibility. The courthouse is the hub for an array of unconventional programs that engage local residents in "doing justice."
