mission: |
  Broadway in South Africa provides a cross-cultural exchange between youth in need and artists who seek to use their talents for positive, global change. BSA brings professional singers, dancers, actors, directors, and musicians based in New York City to work with under privileged children in townships outside of Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, South Africa. In addition, our teaching artists work with children in communities surrounding New York City and Boston, with additional programs planned for Charlotte, Miami, and Chicago.
