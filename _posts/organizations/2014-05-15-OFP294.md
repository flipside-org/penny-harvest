  The Coalition for Asian American Children and Families (CACF) is the nation's only Asian Pacific American children's advocacy organization.  We have been helping children and families for over 25 years.  We believe that children of all backgrounds should have an equal chance to grow up healthy and safe adn should live in a society free from discrimination and prejudice.  Our goal is to improve the lives of Asian Pacific American children and families in New York City.  We help many families, but especially families who struggling with poverty, families who have just moved to America, and families who know little to no English.  We try to improve their lives by fighting for better laws, funding, and services.  Our mission is to make sure that children from all backgrounds have an equal chance to grow up healthy and safe.

    $1000 grant will help one Asian Pacific American youth participate in our leadership program, ASAP (which stands for Asian Pacific American Student Advocacy Project).  ASAP students meet once a week with CACF staff and we talk about ways to improve the community in New York City.  Past topics from the meetings include education, discrimination, and cultural barriers.   This grant would be used for orientation fees, meeting space, food, field trips, and student stipends for youth who participate in ASAP.

    $500 grant will help one Asian Pacific American parent participate in our leadership program, POWER (which stands for Parents Organized to Work for Equal Rights).  Similar to our youth leadership program, POWER meets with staff on a regular basis to talk about ways in improving the Asian Pacific American community in New York City.  However POWER is a two year program and meetings are held once per month.  POWER parents are given $500 stipends at the end of the program, which is often used for childcare, food, and transportation to and from the meetings.
