  We're all about helping.  Help is something everyone needs, and it's what the JCC of Washington Heights & Inwood does.  For people of any age, religion, language, etc.  If one word could define us, it's help.
mission: 

cash_grants: yes

    The JCC of Washington Heights & Inwood's food pantry provides food packages to those who need that extra help to put a meal on the table.  Anyone in need of assistance can pick up a bag of food once every month.  One bag costs $20 so a $1,000 grant would provide food for 50 families for one month.

    We are requesting the maximum grant amount for this program as the food pantry has doubled in the number of people coming to us for help over the past year.

    Seniors can't afford to use taxis, and they often don't feel safe in one either. The JCC has a car which we use to give seniors a ride to the bank, supermarket, even the beauty parlor! We only charge $2 per ride, and the seniors are able to keep living in their own homes and running their own errands. Filling up the car with a tank of gas costs $20 and we fill it up once a week. A grant of $400 would enable us to keep the car service running for 20 weeks.
