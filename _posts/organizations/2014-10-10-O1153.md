mission: |
  SNARR is an animal rescue & rehabilitation center dedicated to giving hope back to the hopeless. 

  We work with animals who are sick, injured, have behavioural issues, or those otherwise considered "unadoptable", and give them the medical and emotional care needed, as well as training to give them a chance at a new beginning, and place them in loving homes best suited to their special needs. 

  We are deeply moved by animals with special needs; however, many of those in our care have a very specific special need -- they need someone like you to love and care for them! We are working to put up pictures of all of our animals available for foster or adoption, and as we do so, we encourage you to have a look, get to know them, and see if, perhaps, YOU have a special need in your heart for one of these sweeties. We have also started listing our animals on Pet Finder.
