  Viking Love NYC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. We started as a group of friends with a very simple goal: to help those in our community who were in desperate need. We believe everyone has a talent or skill that can aid others. As an organization, it is our mission to leverage all of these great talents and skills in order to help people in our community when theyâ€™ve fallen on hard times.
