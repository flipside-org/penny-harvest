  Webster-Giannone Center's mission is to build, develop and inspire the leaders of tomorrow. By helping with the development of character, self-pride, responsibilities and creativity every child will be provided with endless possibilities to express themselves through art, recreation and socialization.

  

  Our after school currently serves children in grades 1st through 5th. Children receive homework assistance, academic enrichment, arts & crafts, recreation, dance and game room. Our youth also participate in Center, Borough and City-wide events where they learn the importance of sportsmanship and teamwork.
