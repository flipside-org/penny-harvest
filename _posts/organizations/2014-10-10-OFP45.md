  Once upon a time there was a teenage girl named Tamisha who could not speak, sit up, walk or move any part of her body except for her head.  But even though she can’t do many of the things that most kids can do, just like every human being, she yearns to be loved and accepted for who she is.  Tamisha went to school just like you do now – except her school was a little bit different.  It was a Special Education High School for young people with all kinds of disabilities – from those who are unable walk and talk and need wheelchairs to move about, to those who have no limitations in their physical movements but have challenges in understanding and interacting in the world, such as individuals with autism.

  

  Blissful Bedrooms is a very special charity that began with two people who simply wanted to make life happier for Tamisha.   You see, Tamisha experienced that special day that we all look forward to in life – Graduation from High School – but instead of it being a happy and joyful time in her life it was one of deep sadness and sorrow.  This was because Tamisha didn’t have a hope-filled and exciting future to look forward to as an independent young adult, for example, going to college, moving out of her parents house, or getting married one day and having a family.  Instead, she was leaving the place she experienced the most contentment and joy in her life with friends who understood her and enjoyed her company.  The day after Graduation Day, Tamisha no longer had a reason to get up each morning and feel excited about the day ahead, because she no longer had anywhere to go ?.

  

  Seeing how depressed and lonely Tamisha was staying home day in and day out, we wanted to help and so we decided to make the place she spends so much time in – her bedroom – a beautiful and special place just for her.  We never expected how happy this small act of kindness would make Tamisha and her family and we were very touched by their reaction.

  

  Blissful Bedrooms is composed entirely of volunteers, which means none of us gets paid to do this work – well not in money anyway, but with lots of love, laughter and smiles.  Our mission is to brighten the everyday lives of young individuals with disabilities.  Through “bedroom makeovers,” Blissful Bedrooms’ volunteers transform the personal spaces of disabled youth, who spend the majority of their existence at home because of limited resources secondary to poverty and severe physical disabilities that make them wheelchair dependent.  These makeovers involve the construction of custom-made furniture and the creation of original art work for each bedroom, all of which are inspired by the recipient’s passions and dreams.   However, we don’t just do a bedroom makeover and leave the person’s life after the weekend is over.  Blissful Bedrooms’ other, equally important mission is to welcome young individuals with disabilities (and their families) into a nurturing community.  We do this by creating regular social events and opportunities for them to get out of their bedrooms, so they can interact with their peers, develop and maintain friendships, have fun and experience the world just like other young people their age do.  These gatherings allow our organization to embrace individuals with a wide range of disabilities (who are not necessarily wheelchair-dependent and a candidate for a bedroom makeover), including those with autism, Down’s Syndrome, mental retardation and other disability classifications, as they too are in strong need of occasions to socialize and enjoy leisure time outside of their home with people who understand and support them. Blissful Bedrooms has a new and exciting project planned to begin in Spring, 2013:  We are building a Blissful Cabin in the Catskills.  The cabin will serve our community as a hub for regular camping trips and retreats for groups of young individuals with disabilities, and as a place where disabled youth and their families can escape the challenges of inner city life, and enjoy the country air and healthy living – a place where they can be with friends who love and accept them just the way they are.

  

  We hope you will be inspired to choose Blissful Bedrooms as the charity you sponsor with all of the pennies you collected.  We can surely use your help as everything we do depends on the generosity and goodness of others.  By helping young individuals with disabilities, you will discover the same secret all of the Blissful Bedrooms volunteers have learned:  It feels so wonderful and amazing to help others in need!

  

  Thank you so much for visiting our page.  Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions at all.  I would love to hear from you!

  

  

  Love and Gratitude,

  Hi I am Martha.  I founded this organization in 2009 because I wanted to help a young disabled girl who was very lonely at home who spends all of her time in her bedroom.  Her bedroom was very plain and boring, and because she cannot move her arms and legs, walk or talk, I thought it would be really cool to make her bedroom look beautiful and contain all her favorite colors and things that were special to her. Our organization received a common cents grant last year from a Special Education school in the Bronx.  This work has completely changed my life in many amazing ways.  It is creative, fun, exciting and it makes many people happy.  I love giving back and I think you will too!!
