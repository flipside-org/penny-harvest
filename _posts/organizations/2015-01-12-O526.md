mission: |
  Handicap International works to improve the living conditions of people living in disabling situations in post-conflict and low income countries around the world. We work with local partners to develop programs in health and rehabilitation and social and economic integration.  We work with local authorities to clear landmines and other war debris and to prevent mine-related accidents through education. We respond fast and effectively to natural and civil disasters in order to limit serious and permanent injuries and to assist survivors' recovery and reintegration. We advocate for the universal recognition of the rights of the disabled through national planning and advocacy.
