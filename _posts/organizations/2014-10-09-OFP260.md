  Not all children have soap to clean themselves, toys to play with, pencils and paper for school,  or even medicine to make them feel better. 

  Save the Children helps by giving children and families’ food, places to go after a disaster, and medical care for babies and children. We are working with over 37 million children all over the world to make them happier, healthier and safer.
mission: |
  Save the Children believes all children have a right to a happy, healthy and secure start in life. But that's far from the experience of millions of children around the world. Instead, their childhoods are marred by poverty, ill-health, war, violence and discrimination. And not just in poorer parts of the globe - far too many children in the UK grow up in circumstances that deny their potential.

    Any amount you can raise will help Save the Children provide life-saving aid to children in need, but here are a few examples of how your donation might be used:

    

    $50: Help Save the Children provide 5 newborn care kits for mothers so the chances of their newborns surviving the risky first month of life are improved.

    

    $100: Provides crucial nutrients and medicine for 4 children in a school setting. 

    $450: Provide a Safe Space Kit including materials to mark off a safe area for children to play, art materials, books, blocks, balls and more.

    $250: Provides a a hand-washing facility that delivers clean water. Clean water, soap, and lessons in hygiene can save at least a million lives a year. 

    $800: Build a preschool so that children can get a good start in life.

    2 million newborn babies who die each year could be saved by simple measures, like placing a knit cap on a baby's head for warmth. Host a knitting party at your school and donate the caps to Save the Children's Caps to the Capital campaign, along with a letter asking the president for help!
