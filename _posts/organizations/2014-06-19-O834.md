mission: |
  We were once again tragically reminded of the frailty of our existence as Hurricane Sandy shattered lives and devastated property across the Northeast. No area was hit worse than our hometown of Staten Island. Normally resilient people were brought to their knees, left shocked, without shelter and life sustaining necessities, but also, seemingly without hope. Needs were at critical, life threatening levels and deteriorating rapidly. Without any hesitation, people stopped what they were doing and sprung into action, digging in and doing whatever it took, not the least of which was writing checks and tapping other valuable resources. Without a doubt, your willingness to contribute at such a dire time has already saved lives and will forever be the difference in restoring normalcy for so many families. From the depths of despair, humility is stirred.
