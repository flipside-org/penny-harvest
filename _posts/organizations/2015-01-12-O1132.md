mission: |
  Seeds of Love is a small, but growing, group of family and friends who volunteer their time to make the world a better place.  Since sprouting in June 2007, Seeds of Love has not stopped planting seeds! They have been collecting donated goods and turning overstock items into cash donations. They plan on continuing to plant seeds of love and hope, wherever they can, one seed at a time.
