  There are so many children with disabilities in New York City who do not get to experience things that other children take for granted. Playing different kinds of sports, learning how to swim, making friends with peers, and just communicating with people around them can often be difficult. Project HAPPY is a place where children with disabilities can feel accepted and welcome.
mission: |
  Project HAPPYâ€™s mission is to promote the well-being of New York Cityâ€™s children, youth and young adults with disabilities by providing them with individual and team sports and recreational activities. In doing so, we aim to impart improved physical health, social skills, and self-confidence in those who are often marginalized as a result of their impairments. Additionally, we strive to advocate for, and provide awareness of, the needs of urban children, youth and young adults who have disabilities.

    A large portion of Project HAPPY's participants have autism. Our project proposal is to create a support group.  This would allow  our autistic participants to have an opportunity to express themselves. The group will be led by a licensed social worker who will introduce appropriate methods of communication.  The participants who will be selected to participate in this project are high functioning 12 to 14 year olds who have autism.  The support group will attempt to help them overcome behaviors associated with autism, which could potentially make them feel isolated.  We hope to teach them strategies for dealing with the kind of issues that are particularly stressful to this population, such as crowded subways, noisy workplaces and other everyday situations that typical people often take for granted. Because they are high functioning, they are aware that they are autistic and are developing a sense that they are different from typical teenagers. In order to hire the social worker we need to run this support group for our autistic teens, we are asking for help. The price per session is about $50. We hope to have 12 sessions in the Fall and 12 sessions in the Spring this year.

  When I was born there was a popular song called "Pennies from Heaven", so my parents named me Penny after the song. That is one of the reasons I have a special affection  for the Penny Harvest Program. I have been the director of Project HAPPY since it stared thirty-

  two years ago.  At Project HAPPY I am lucky because I get to see people with disabilities learn to swim and play basketball and do all sorts of activities that they might not have a chance to do otherwise.
