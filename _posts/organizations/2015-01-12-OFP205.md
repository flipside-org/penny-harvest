description: |
  Cystic Fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease that affects over 30,000 Americans.  This disease is marked by chronic infections, clogged airways, and digestive and reproductive problems.

  

  In Cystic Fibrosis patients, problems occur because the mucus in their lungs is very thick and sticky.  Instead of serving as a lubricant, it clogs the respiratory system and allows bacteria to grow within it, impairing the body’s natural defenses.  The thick mucus also obstructs the pancreas, preventing enzymes from reaching the intestines to digest food.

  The prognosis is encouraging: in the 1960s, children struck by the disease were not expected to reach their 8th birthday; today, most have an average lifespan of 30 years.

  For the past couple of years, I have been jumping into Lake Mahopac for a little wonderful little girl! Well, like last year Jenna’s travel soccer team, the Golden Hawks will be jumping in the lake to sponsor their teammate, Jacqueline. Jacqueline  is the most vibrant and energetic child I have ever met. What I am asking for is all of you to sponsor our team, Mahopac Golden Hawks to take that jump into the lake.
