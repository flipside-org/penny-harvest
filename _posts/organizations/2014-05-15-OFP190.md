  Only Make Believe (OMB) is a unique theatrical non-profit organization dedicated to children and their families from underserved communities who are facing medical challenges. The company was founded by Dena Hammerstein in 1999 to introduce theater to hospitalized children aged between four and sixteen. OMB believes in the value of helping children cope with debilitating illnesses in a positive, engaging and safe environment that builds confidence and unlocks a child’s innate capacity for creativity.

  OMB presents 6-week cycles of theatrical workshops free-of-charge to children in medical facilities citywide. OMB’s troupe consists of professional actors who are racially diverse and bilingual and mirror the diversity of the children we serve. Only Make Believe offers a structured play/workshop designed specifically to include the audience in the storytelling process. Thus, the children are involved in a shared experience which builds their confidence, creates community and gives a public voice to unheard children. These children find solace, support and creative stimulation through our program. At Only make Believe we are committed to serving children in need creating an environment where children can focus on their strengths rather than their disabilities.

  Hi!

  I'm Lauren. I've been working with OMB for a little over two years. I organize all the fundraising efforts for OMB. We take theater workshops into the hospitals (free-of-

  charge) for kids living with chronic illnesses and disabilities. Our program really helps put a smile on all the children's faces.
