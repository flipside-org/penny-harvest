description: |
  For over 60 years, the Childrenâ€™s Cancer & Blood Foundation (CCBF) has been helping children with cancer and blood disorders at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. We help to give children medicine at the hospital, even when they donâ€™t have enough money to pay for the medicine. We also help doctors find new medicine to make the children feel even better so they can have a very long life. Your support will help even more children get the medicine and care that they need.
