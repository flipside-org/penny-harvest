  Ruff House Rescue finds needy animals permanent homes.  We rescue from kill shelters in New York and other states, we rescue strays, and we rescue animals whose owners can no longer care for them.  We make sure each animal goes to the vet, gets vaccinated, gets spayed/neutered, gets microchipped, and gets a loving fur-ever home.

  Hi there!  My name is Diane and I am the director of a wonderful organization named Ruff House Rescue.  I am animal lover and the founder of this rescue group.  Here at Ruff House, we rescue hundreds of animals every year and find them loving homes.  Many of our animals come from the high-kill shelters down South, where they are killing dogs simply because they don't have enough room for them.   We transport the dogs up to New York, then get them taken care of with shots and spaying/neutering, and then we find them homes.  We believe that there is a home for each and every animal and we do our best to find that home.  We use Facebook and Twitter and our website, as well as hosting adoption events at different locations.  Check our website and come down to meet the pups!
