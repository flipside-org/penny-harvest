    Socializing is an important concern for the elderly. The Selfhelp Benjamin Rosenthal-Prince Street Senior Center (Selfhelp Innovative Senior Center) focuses on providing various opportunities for socialization and friendship. Through funded programs such as a Valentine's Sweet Heart Dance or a Volunteer Recognition Event would enable the seniors to come together to socialize and enjoy themselves. The Center received $600 in the previous year.

    Our center also helped out

    immediately after the disaster caused by hurricane sandy by locating shelters for seniors who lost electricity, but is no longer taking donations for

    Hurricane Sandy relief.

    The Center has had partnership with Elders Share the Arts (ESTA)for many years. The program helps bridge the gap between the generations by bringing together seniors and students from a local elementary school. Through an oral history project the seniors and the students learn a great deal about various cultures and the generations. The Center's share of the cost for the creative arts consultant for the program is $1,000. Funding has been cut 3% by the City and a cash grant would enable this wonderful program to continue.
