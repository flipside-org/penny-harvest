mission: |
  For more than 20 years, Just-Us, Inc. has provided supportive services to youth who have been identified as being "at risk" due to educational underachievement, the lack of employment opportunities, or difficultly in adapting to their social environment.  Each year more than 200 young people, from 7-21 years of age, take part in the Just-Us program.  Particularly, our agency reaches out to youth in the metropolitan area.  Our goal is to provide a safe environment as well as a positive and caring relationship with adults and peers.  We support the needs of working families and also support the health and physical being of our participants.
