  The Bowery Mission has been helping homeless men and women for 127 years.  People are homeless for a variety of reasons, but it means they don’t have a home where they can sleep and eat.  At The Bowery Mission, we make sure homeless men and women have a safe place to sleep, warm meals to eat, clean clothes to wear.  People can get a shower or they can see a doctor.  We have three shelters where people can stay.  Two shelters are for men and one is for women.  Almost 200 people at a time stay at our shelters.  Most people who come to our shelters stay for a while until they can find a place of their own to stay.  In New York, there are lots of people who are hungry for a good meal.  Last year, we served 900 meals every single day at just one of our shelters!  Most of the time, people come inside to eat, but sometimes we go outside and serve meals on the sidewalk.
mission: |
  Rebuilding lives since 1879.

  We are called to minister in New York City to men, women and children caught in cycles of poverty, hopelessness and dependencies of many kinds, and to see their lives transformed to hope, joy, lasting productivity and eternal life through the power of Jesus Christ.

    Help the homeless get a good meal  A lot of the food at The Bowery Mission is donated, so it costs us only $1.59 for each meal we serve.  It’s a real bargain!  You could figure out how many meals you want to buy.  You could buy 100 meals for $159 or 200 meals for $318 or 300 meals for $477.

    Help the homeless learn new skills  We have three Career Centers, where men and women can learn how to use computers or be trained in other skills.  Some men and women who never finished high school can earn their diplomas at our Career Centers.  It costs $155 to run a Career Center for one day.  You can decide how many days you would like to sponsor: two days cost $310 and three days cost $620.

    Food Drive  Your school could have a contest at school to see what class could collect the most food for the homeless.  Before you start, be sure to ask us at The Bowery Mission what kinds of food we need the most.  For one week, students can bring the food to school.  At the end of the contest, you can have prizes for the winning class.

    Clothing Drive  Do your parents have clothes in their closet that they never wear?  What about your friends’ parents?  You could ask them to share their clothes with the homeless.  Then you could get someone to take all of the clothes and drop them off at The Bowery Mission.

  My name is Blair and I have been working at The Bowery Mission for 3 years.  At The Bowery Mission, I help to raise money through fundraising events.  These events bring awareness to what The Bowery Mission does and also raises money to fund our programs and help feed those in need.  Fundraising events are just one way that people choose to give.  I have not worked with Common Cents schools in the past, but I look forward to meeting you!
