description: 
mission: |
  venerable member of the community, Harlem Hospital was founded in 1887. Today, at 400 beds, it is the largest health facility in Harlem capable of treating the most seriously ill. Harlem has one of the finest trauma teams in the nation, and the new Urgent Care Center has reduced waiting time in our busy, 911-designated, Level I Emergency Department. Special Asthma Treatment and Pediatric Emergency Units provide specialized critical care. Harlem also operates one of only a few Burn Units in New York City that includes a specialty in plastic and reconstructive surgery to reduce the scarring unique to the minority community.
