  Our chapter of the National MS Society works hard to raise money to help support research to find a cure for MS. Until a cure is found, we work to make the lives of people with MS better through our programs and services. We offer counseling, support groups, recreational activities, home care, meals, equipment, emergency financial assistance, information, resources, legal and employment advice and educational programs for people of all ages living with MS and their family members.

  Hi Kids:

  I had the priveldge of attending a check ceremony at PS 23 in Staten Island and I am feeling incredibly moved by the work that you as young philanthropists are doing.  I am a social worker and have been with the National MS Society for about 7 years.  I really love my job.  I get to plan programs that teach people all about MS and how to live with it.  Lots of people are diagnosed with MS and don't even know what it is but have to begin making decisions about their health care.  So we believe its important for people to know as much as possible about MS so they can work with their doctors and stay well.  Another part of my job is helping people who are Spanish speaking to learn more about MS and to get access to all the resources that other people with MS are using.  Please let me know if you have more questions about what I do at our chapter.
