    Each year CDSC has a special Thanksgiving pantry. We collect donations of food and money in the hopes of providing approximately 300 families with food packages that allow them to cook a complete Thanksgiving meal. A donation of $1000 would go a long way towards bringing families some holiday cheer.

    We grow our own vegetables inside our building. We use a system called hydroponic.  This system means that we use water, nutrients and lights instead of soil and sunlight to grow our vegetables. When the vegetables are ready to be eaten, we harvest them and give them away to individuals and families who come to our food pantry. People who come to our food pantry have a  hard time finding money to buy fresh vegetables.  With a cash grant, we would buy seeds, nutrients, and growing cubes to keep growing the vegetables. The cost to grow vegetables for six months is about $500.00

    CDSC's hydroponic farm provides an exciting and engaging volunteer and learning opportunity. Students can come volunteer and expect to do tasks such as general maintenance of the farm (sweeping, cleaning, etc.), planting, and harvesting plants. In the process they also get to learn how hydroponics differs from traditional growing in soil.

  Hello! My name is Mireille and I have been working with CDSC in various roles for over 21 years. I have the opportunity to be involved in so many projects because we are a small organization doing big things, such as our emergency food pantry, hydroponic farm, and arts programming. All we do at CDSC though is done with the mindset of bettering the body, mind, and soul of our community members.
