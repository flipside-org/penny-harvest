mission: |
  Direct Relief International provides medical material aid including medicines, medical supplies and equipment to strengthen in-country health efforts around the world to improve the quality of life for the most impoverished people. In 2005, Direct Relief provided $211 million (wholesale) in medical material aid serving 29.1 million people in 51 countries worldwide. For every dollar we spend, we leverage that support to help six people in need with medicines and supplies worth nearly $30 wholesale.
