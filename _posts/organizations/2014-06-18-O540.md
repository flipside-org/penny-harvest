mission: |
  The mission of the Heavenly Angels Animal helter is to facilitate the placement of animals from puppy mills, owner surrenders, high kill shelters, or just abanoned and place them in desirable loving homes; until then, we will provide and maintain a sheltter for them and provide food, shelter and health care. All of our animals are spay/neutered. The animals in our care, are guests, and are never euthanized merely because we lack space or because the animal's stay with us has exceeded a predefined amount if time. We are non-profit and able to do this only through the help of our volunteer and donations.
