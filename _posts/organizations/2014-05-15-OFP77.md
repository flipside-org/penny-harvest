  For the past 27 years, we have provided a home-away-from-home and support for families whose ill or injured children are receiving treatment through Children's Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, NH. We make sure parents, brothers, sisters, and other family members can be close to a hospitalized child for as long as the child is in the hospital. We do not charge families to stay with us, and are the only home available for families who choose to have their child treated at this world-renowned children's hospital.

  About Us

  David’s House is the dream of a young boy named David Cyr, who passed away from leukemia in 1984 at the age of five. For three and a half years, David was treated at Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in Hanover, NH. Visiting David during his hospitalizations was easy for his parents who lived only 20 minutes away. But during this time his family met others who didn’t have that option; instead they slept in their cars, in the waiting room, or in a chair at bedside to be close to their child

    We have recently come up with the follow approximated costs to run our guest services program:

    $50 - cost to provide the house with milk for a month

    $75 - cost of one night's stay for one family

    $150 - cost to do 50 loads of guest and housekeeping laundry

    $300.78 - amount of money David's Cyr, whom we're named after, had saved before he died. This was the first money to start David's House.

    $500 - cost of a room for one family for a week

    $1,000 - cost of food and supplies for 19 families (# we can accommodate) for one month

    We ask for donations to offset the expenses listed above. Perhaps instead of cash, the students could organize a collection of gift cards to chain stores, which we could then use to purchase items or to give directly to families who are in need. Gas cards are also helpful for families who have to travel to the hospital multiple times for treatments.

    Because we are located in western New Hampshire, it is difficult to spread the word throughout the country that we are helping families from other states. Perhaps the students could help with a media blitz to resources within your state spreading the word about what we do. To date, we have housed over 213 families from New York.

  I have been the development director at David's House for the past 5 years, and as part of my role I meet with groups who want to do fundraisers for us. Because we serve families from around the country (and world), I am able to travel to let people know who we are and how we've helped people in different states and communities. I am also responsible for all of our publicity, grant writing, and event planning.
