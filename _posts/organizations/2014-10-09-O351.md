mission: |
  DNET programs select students who are not able to attend school due to financial reasons.  A DNET program monitor in the field pays tuition, provides books and uniforms, and assures that the children meet attendance and performance requirements in school.  In addition, the children's families receive a stipend to relieve the students of the need to work.  Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states "Elementary education shall be compulsory."  In the impoverished rural areas of northern India, however, basic education often falls by the wayside as families struggle to earn their daily meals. By providing scholarships, books, and uniform donations, the Deoki Nandan Education Trust strives to ensure that all Indian children have access to education.
