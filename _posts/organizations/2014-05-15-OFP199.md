  CHIPS started in 1971 and feeds the hungry and poor 6 days a week and all holidays. Grocery bags are available every Friday for needy families and used clothing daily. On the top three floors we have young pregnant, homeless Mothers and their infants and toddlers. This is a year long program.
mission: |
  Our goal is to work together with the church communities, merchants, civic community, business people, volunteers, our neighbors and guests to improve our lives; hopefully bringing dignity, health, freedom and peace to all, so that we may become whole and holy people.

  Chips serves 60,000 meals a year. A small amount of the food is purchased with donated funds, but most of it is donated by food stores, bakeries and restaurants, some of which have been regular contributors for decades. Other food comes from food drives, collection centers, collection parties hosted by individuals, and personal contributors.
