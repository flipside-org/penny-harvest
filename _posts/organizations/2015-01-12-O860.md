  NCPC believes that Crime can and should be prevented.Truly effective prevention requires addressing causes of crime and reducing opportunities for it to occur. Everyone, no matter what age, position, or capacity, can and must take individual action to stop crime. The problems of crime, violence, and drug abuse are best addressed though local action supported by local and state policies. Comprehensive crime prevention action plans (coordinated strategies and policies that address causes as well as occurrences of crime) are vital to long-term community success against crime. Partnerships that actively involve the local community and its residents are key to preventing crime. Prevention is a highly cost-effective alternative to the costs of crime to individuals and neighborhoods. Crime prevention action should be grounded in research and tested approaches and aided by evaluation.
