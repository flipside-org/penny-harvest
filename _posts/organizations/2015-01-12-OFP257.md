We provide our clients with a wide range of services including safe housing, counseling, legal advice, and even assistance with their economic needs.

    Sanctuary donates clothing to the families that seek our help.  We run a clothing boutique at our Manhattan Office where domestic violence survivors and their children can select from a range of new and gently used donations in a calming and empowering environment.  We provide clothing, accessories, and shoes for infants, school age children, teens, and adults.  Clothing is sorted by size and style and the concept is to make the experience as similar to going to a store as possible.  One outfit for a child on average can cost Sanctuary $25.00.   A grant in the amount of $1,000 can help provide a new outfit to 40 kids!

    One of the most immediate ways that Sanctuary helps our clients is through emergency food supplies.  Over the last year, emergency food needs of our clients became more urgent as the economy worsened and unemployment rates increased.  Overall, 300 families annually and over 50 families per month utilize our three food pantry locations, with a total of 1,200 visits annually, and Sanctuary spends thousands of dollars on this resource.  On average, one box of rice or pasta costs Sanctuary $2.00, and a cash grant of  $200 would provide us with 100 boxes of rice, which would help us put food on the table for many many needy families!

    Children and teen clothing in good condition is always in need here at Sanctuary.  We display the items for our clients in our onsite clothing boutique, and this helps our clients save a lot of money, and time.  By organizing a clothing drive of new and gently used items, you can help Sanctuary provide an important resource to the families that come to us seeking help.

    When domestic violence victims and their children flee to safety and enter shelter, they often have to leave everything behind.  Books are too heavy to bring, and are far too costly to replace right away.   For safety reasons, children have to change schools. All of this, combined with the trauma associated with domestic violence, often prevent children from developing a strong interest in reading and can have a negative effect on their performance in school.  

    A book drive would be an important way you can assist Sanctuary help the children, and families that we serve.  The books will be used throughout the childrenâ€™s programs offered by Sanctuary for Families. The books would be utilized by staff and volunteers to encourage literacy and reading.   We also like to give our books away to moms and children to foster reading outside of the agency.  For older children, books are a tool to help explore their interests and provide them with a way to escape their daily stresses.

  Hello students. My name is Susan, and my job is to plan special events for Sanctuary for Families, and work with individual donors who support our work.  I have worked at Sanctuary for over six years, and feel very passionate about our work and helping families in need living in New York.  The best part of my job is raising money and support for our clients who come to us for help. This is the first time Sanctuary has worked with Common Cents, and we look forward to partnering with you and making a difference together!
