  Unfortunately some parents reject their child when they discover that he or she is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). Sometimes they even kick their child out of their house. These homeless young  LGBT people are left to try to survive on the streets. At the Ali Forney Center (AFC), we are making a difference by rescuing kids from the  the streets and placing them into our safe, homelike environments.

  

  The Ali Forney Center is working hard to provide our youth with the support hey need to succeed and succeed. We cannot do this work alone. We need the help and support of the community to make NYC a safer place for homeless lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth. Thank you for your support and interest.
