mission: |
  It is our hope to help families with children who suffer from a dihabilitating disease enjoy the big and little things in life. We want to ease their struggles as they create their own version of "normal", so they too can enjoy their time with their child. We are grateful for all your support and hope you can help us write the next chapter in memory of an amazing little boy who started our story. Just as a tree has many branches, we hope to reach out to other families to provide them the opportunity to begin a story of their own.
