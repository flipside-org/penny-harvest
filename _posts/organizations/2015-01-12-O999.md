mission: |
  Project Morry is a nonprofit, year-round youth development organization, anchored by a residential summer camp with an educational focus. The organization is dedicated to giving inner-city children enriching learning opportunities through a curriculum based on school gatherings and an intensive summer camp program. The children, for whom these experiences would not otherwise be available, benefit from a network of support and gain increased social skills, enhanced self-esteem, positive core values and a greater sense of personal responsibility.
