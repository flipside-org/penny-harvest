  My name is Megan and I'm excited to partner with Common Cents through the Children of China Pediatrics Foundation.I worked with Common Cents a few years back when I was with Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City. I had the opportunity to meet with several of the participating schools and very much enjoyed meeting the intelligent and caring students involved with the Common Cents program.
