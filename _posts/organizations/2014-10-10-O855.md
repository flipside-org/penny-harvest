  The National Breast Cancer Foundation mission is to save lives by increasing awareness of breast cancer through education and by providing mammograms for those in need. NBCF accomplishes this mission through our initiatives, such as the National Mammography Program (NMP), Beyond the Shock educational video, MyNBCF online community, and the Early Detection Plan. NBCF programs provide women help for today and hope for tomorrow.
