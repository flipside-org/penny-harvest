  Today, one out of every five children in the U.S. has some type of special healthcare need. In New York State alone that's more than 800,000 children who need special care from doctors, nurses, therapists, and special educators. 

  Each day, St. Mary’s Healthcare System for Children, a non-profit and non-sectarian organization, cares for 4000 of New York's special children at our hospital, in their homes, and in the community. Some of these children were born prematurely and have problems with things that we may take for granted like eating and breathing. Other children were victims of severe injuries – like car accidents and fires – and come to St. Mary’s to relearn to walk and talk.  And yet other kids have serious illnesses that require special care, medications, and equipment. Many of these children have long-term complications that require ongoing care.

  

  There are lots of reasons why children and their families come to St. Mary’s, but the one thing they all have in common is a desire to get better and get stronger. St. Mary’s works had every day to improve the health and quality of life for our children. We help make miracles happen, but we need your help as well. 

  There is nothing more powerful than kids helping kids! You can help make a difference by joining the 1in5 Kids Campaign!

    Many of the families we serve are economically and socially disadvantaged so they often go without on special occasions like birthdays and holidays.  To help, you could hold a drive to collect new clothing, food or gift certificates.

  Hi - One of the most satisfying aspects of my job is seeing kids help kids. All children are special, yet it takes a very special child to help a child in need; and you are special because you are reading this right now! I also know that when you read our children’s stories you will recognize people you know - friends, siblings, teachers, parents, coaches, and yourself too. You will also recognize traits you admire in our children – bravery, courage and determination.  Spend some time and learn as much as you can about our children. Once you decide to help us you will do it with all your heart, which is all we can ask.  Thank you for helping us care of our special children.
