  Founded in 1939, The Greenpoint Lions Club's mission is to brighten the lives and spirits of those families in greatest need.  The Greenpoint Lions Club is the organization that runs the Toys for Tots Campaign to assist Greenpoint youth and their families during the holiday and throughout the year.  Every year, the Greenpoint Lions Club holds multiple food drives for local food pantries to assist families in need.
