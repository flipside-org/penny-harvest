  The mission of ASSM is to take an affirmative role in the community by providing services such as our temporary emergency food program, clothing, counseling, womenâ€™s residence and referral service.  With the growing social needs in our community our services have expanded to assist in aiding our fellow church assemblies and the Bedford Stuyvesant residents.
