  The New York Aquarium celebrates the wonders of the ocean and educates visitors about marine animals and conservation.  Its buildings were recently devastated by the impact of Hurricane Sandy. We are committed to rebuilding and transforming the Aquarium, to come back better than ever.  This process will take several years to complete.
mission: |
  to save wildlife and wild places across the globe. Our story began in the early 1900’s when we successfully helped the American bison recover on the Western Plains. Today, we protect many of the world’s iconic creatures here and abroad.

  During our 115 years, we have forged the power of our global conservation work and the management of our five parks in New York City to create the world’s most comprehensive conservation organization. We currently manage about 500 conservation projects in more than 60 countries; and educate millions of visitors at our five living institutions in New York City on important issues affecting our planet. Our parks include The Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, Prospect Park Zoo, Queen Zoo and Central Park Zoo
