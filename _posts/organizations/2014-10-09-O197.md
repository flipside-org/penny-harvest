mission: |
  Build It Green! NYC, is New York City's only non-profit retail outlet for salvaged and surplus building materials. Our reuse centers have everything from panel doors to high end refrigerators and shutters to movie props. Our mission is to keep these materials out of the landfill, while offering deep discounts on their resale. We are working towards reducing the amount of unnecessary construction and demolition (C&D) waste clogging our landfills, which contributes to pollution, GHG emissions, climate change and global warming.

  

  Founded in late 2004, our Astoria warehouse opened in February of 2005. Our second reuse center opened in Gowanus, Brooklyn in November 2011.
