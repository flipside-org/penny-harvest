  Have you ever really, really loved a book? Many blind children would never know the feeling of falling in love with their own braille books without the help of Seedlings Braille Books for Children!  Seedlings has made it possible for blind children to have their very own braille book.  We make braille books for children who read with the tips of their fingers.  Seedlings has over 1,300 titles in braille for blind children to choose from at a very low cost. Many of the popular bookstores do not sell braille books. Other places sell them at a very high cost, so blind children have to borrow them from a library.  At Seedlings, we sell our braille books at a very low price so families can afford to buy them.  Seedlings also has many programs where books are given away free.  It is very important for all children, both blind and sighted, to learn to read and enjoy books at an early age.  Seedlings is making a difference in the lives of those special children who read by touch.

    Grants help pay for the production of braille books for blind children.  Many books would be produced in print-and-braille format so that blind and sighted family members can read together.  Our books are made available for an average cost of only $10 each which is below the actual cost to produce a book.  Seedlings relies on generous contributions from groups to help keep the books affordable for families.  Since Seedlings began in 1984, over 265,000 braille books and articles have been produced.

    Grants are also used to fund our Book Angel Project.  In loving memory of Anna Kirstina Bonde, the daughter of Seedlings’ director and founder, Debra Bonde, hundreds of braille books that have been made in her name are given away free. How does it work?  Just register online and Seedlings will send two (2) free braille books to any visually impaired child in the U.S. and Canada.

    If you like to bowl, we suggest a "Bowl Where You Are" fundraising opportunity to help us make braille books affordable.  Individuals or groups are invited to bowl anywhere and anytime in the name of braille literacy to support Seedlings Braille Books for Children.  We can help by providing materials and prizes.

    The lives of many children and families have been changed by Seedlings mission and the service projects and contributions from people who want to make a difference. We have had many school children hold bake sales or sell popcorn on Fridays.  Some schools have read-a-thons and one school had a bottle and can drive to collect money.   During the holidays, children will give donations to Seedlings instead of a gift exchange.

  Seedlings’ founder, Debra Bonde became very aware that blind children did not have the same opportunity as her daughters to own, read, and learn to love books.  She was also concerned that blind parents could not find children’s books in braille to read to their own children.  The few braille books that were available were so costly that most families could not afford to purchase them. Being the mother of two small children, Debra knew the joy that children experienced of owning their own books.  As she witnessed her own daughter’s library of treasured books growing, she vowed to find a way to make children’s books in braille readily accessible and affordable for families.  

  In 1984, Seedlings Braille Books for Children was founded in the basement of her home.  Debra Bonde has been bringing the joy of reading to countless blind children worldwide for 29 years, by making braille books affordable for families and allowing blind and sighted family members to read together.  Seedlings Braille Books for Children has opened up a whole new world of reading for thousands of blind children nationwide and around the globe.
