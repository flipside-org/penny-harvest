  BSCAH works very hard to help families that have no food to eat. These families also need information to help get services that address homelessness, like food stamps, health care, nutrition, and education.  We have a difficult time finding food, as there is a nationwide food shortage.  Food prices have increased, and many times we can not buy food especially milk, cereal, rice, meat, and juice.  Sometimes we have to turn families away because our supermarket style pantry has no food.  This is very sad, and at time mothers begin to cry when we tell them there is no food.  This is very painful to see families, especially children, go without food.  We also help families that are sick and suffer because they don't have money to buy the right food group.  Many eat food that makes them very sick, so we educate them on eating right and exercising.  We even have a cooking class for children, pregnant mothers and the elderly.

  My name is Tamara Dawson. I am 29 years old with a Marketing Degree.  Unfortunately, I had a back injury that would not allow me to work. Things became difficult for my family and I, as my husband also lost his job, so I went to G.R.A.C.E./BedStuy Campaign Against Hunger Food and Services for my family. Then, I began volunteering and the rest has become history.  I still have a back injury and cannot do much lifting but I love feeding those that come for food.  I do all marketing brochures and fliers.  I love helping families prepare for their cooking classes and in the fall we take them to a farm and also go on a hay ride.
