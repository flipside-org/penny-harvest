mission: |
  The mission of the J-CAP organization is to help people learn to help themselves. J-CAPâ€™s Therapeutic Community (TC)* is designed to reach and direct people toward recovery through dynamic personal growth and social interaction. All participants in our TC are welcomed into a supportive residential environment with respect and shown responsible concern regardless of their gender, race, political ideas, religious beliefs, or medical, physical or mental disabilities. We are mindful of the past yet focused on the future.
