  The Caribbean Cultural Center is a not for profit cultural organization based in New York City dedicated to promoting and promulgating the cultures of people of African Descent brought before and after the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Through concerts, gallery tours, workshops, performances, conferences, professional development sessions, spiritual gatherings, and teaching artists residencies, we support teachers, and students across New York to learn and grow through the arts.
