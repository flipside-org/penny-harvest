  SCO Family of Services provides unconditional care to those who need it the most.  We help children, families and adults overcome devastating circumstances to become healthy, safe and successful.
mission: |
  SCO operates more than 60 programs at 102 locations. We provide necessary services and unconditional care to more than 60,000 of New York’s most vulnerable people – from homeless families to struggling teenagers, from families at-risk to disabled adults. Our services range from groundbreaking early education programs to the state’s first residential school for high-performing adolescents with autism.

  SCO produces life-changing results for individuals and families by focusing on safety, stability and mastery, by building resilience and strengthening the capacity to make meaningful connections and function independently in the community.
