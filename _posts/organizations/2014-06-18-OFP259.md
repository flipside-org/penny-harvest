  Save Our Strays is a Grass Roots organization. We organized in 1968, and incorporated in 1972.

  

  In New York City, and cities across America, people do not care enough about homeless animals. We here at Save Our Strays are trying to help in our way.

  

  There are thousands of sick, injured, hungry, and thirsty strays across America, in streets, parks, and alleyways. The shelters in the city and tri-state area are usually filled to capacity. Funding has been cut to city agencies, so that Animal care and control cannot just go out and pick up all the thousands of strays in the city. So what can we do? We are limited in what we can do, as funds available dictate what we can and cannot do for the strays.

  

  Programs we have set up to help these helpless dogs and cats are:

  1) We have set up a Feeding Program, and have volunteers who work with us, in feeding strays in various parts of the city.

  1a) Through Save Our Strays, we have given pet food to people on limited incomes from time to time, in all boroughs of New York City, depending on funds available and per situation.

   2) We work with several local veterinarians, who offer discount veterinary care to help people who are on a fixed income to treat and care for their pets. When funds are available, we help with paying part of their veterinary bills.

   3) These veterinarians also work with rescuers, who offer them discounts for the animals that they save.

   4) When our volunteers find a group of animals in the same area, that tend to stay together, this is called a colony. They watch over the group by feeding them, and they are aware if an animal becomes in need of medical treatment. We help with the veterinary bills through the veterinarians that we work with.

   5) We maintain a 24 hour/7 day a week answering service to guide people with emergencies, i.e.: advice, medical treatment, etc.

   6) When and where we can, we find homes for adoptable strays and also try to have strays placed in no-kill shelters, depending on room availability.

   7) All our work depends on donations that are given to us by the generosity of the community.

  During the fall of 1994, Dave Amick, Terri Gary & Sandy Dorton recognized the problems confronting the stray cats in Pinellas County. These friends decided to form a non-profit, humane organization whose mission would be to shelter and re-home abandoned and homeless cats and kittens.

  Good Day Students,

  I am Linda Abad, and I am the new Administrative Director for Save Our Strays, Inc. I have been with this organization since 1990, a total of 21 years. I arrange all staff schedules, and coordinate our programs, with the volunteer feeders, and rescuers. There are times that I go out in the field, with the feeders and rescuers to supervise and help with the strays. This is very rewarding, to have "hands on" with the strays.

   We acknowledge the students and schools, who have given us a grant by thanking them in our monthly newsletter.  The students who participate in this program, are the new generation of future lawyers, doctors, judges, and parents, who will carry on the work to bring injustice for stray animals to an end.

  That is YOU.
