    Worm Bin Composting Workshop for a School

    Got a smelly trash can? Hate taking out the garbage every week? Or want to reduce the amount of trash you produce? Then indoor composting may be for you! Red wiggler worms rapidly eat kitchen scraps transforming all of this “waste” into a useful fertilizer, aka NYC Black Gold that can then be fed to hungry plants and trees! Learn how to set up and maintain a worm bin in your school classroom.

    Cost: $200

  Hello! My name is Caroline Kruse and I help make sure all of our programs are the best they possibly can be. I have been working at the Lower East Side Ecology Center since 2008 and I have a really fun job!  I get to go out and talk to lots of people about the Ecology Center and also make sure that people who want to participate in our programs can. The Ecology Center has worked with Common Cents in the past, and I am excited to work your guys!
