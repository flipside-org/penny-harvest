  For over 20 years PCI-Media Impact has been dedicated to helping people in need.  What we do is try to find out what problems are happening in our surrounding countries.  We have worked with over 27 countries, including China, India, Latin America, and Africa.  Once we've identified an important problem (like hunger, immigration, women and children's rights, or environment clean up) PCI-Media Impact comes up with a plan to help the people that are suffering from a problem.  Once a plan is formed we make it into a radio program.  PCI-Media Impact flies to the country in need of their help and teaches the local community members how to start a radio show.  The radio show deals with the certain problem that community is facing.  For example if a community is having a problem with environmental cleanliness, the radio program will talk about a farmer and his family and will discuss ways that the farmer can keep his earth clean.  PCI-Media Impact also makes sure that the community is taught how to run the radio program even when PCI-Media leaves to come back to NYC.  We want to help communities in need and also make sure that they can continue to help themselves.

    A Dontion would help the above countries.

    $50 helps our expert trainers travel to one of the above countries to help the community learn how to fix their problem

    

    $200 helps supply energy-efficient digital recording equipment to the local broadcasting partners so the community can hold their educational radio program

    

    $500 helps community leaders to attend workshops that help teach how to run a radio program to educate their community on important issues

    

    $1,000 helps pay for the radio program to write a script for their radio talk show.  The script makes sure that the radio talk show discusses all the important issues of the local community.  For example, if their important issue is hunger, the radio program will talk about why their community members are suffering from hunger and what everyone can do to help out.

  Hi, my name is Sylvia Torres, and I am part of the Development and Communication department in PCI-Media Impact.  I help manage both the individual giving and the communication strategies for PCI-Media Impact.  That means when PCI-Media Impact has an idea for a program to help a community in need, I work at making sure the program works smoothly and efficiently.
