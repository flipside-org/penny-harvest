    Sponsor a small business: Please join us in supporting businesses with interest-free funds that will help them start or grow their businesses.  The businesses will help young adults who do not have a job to improve their lives and escape from poverty.   This support will help them take care of their families and send their children to school.  The funds are repaid after a year and provided to other people â€“ so the impact keeps extending.  They also receive training to help them better run their businesses.  Additionally, they meet regularly to share experiences and what they have learned. Grant amount: $300.

    Children in Africa are in desperate need of school supplies. The average student lacks the basic, essential school supplies that will improve the quality of their learning and education.  These supplies include items such as pencils, pens, backpacks, calculators, notebooks, rulers, erasers, pencil sharpeners and cases. The supplies will be distributed free to schools in Africa.  This provides a great opportunity to make a difference to a child in need in Africa by providing items they would appreciate and would help them be better students.  You can run a school supplies drive for a month and also collect supplies from local businesses.

  I am the President and founder of the organization.  My work with Develop Africa involves helping the organization grow and organizing activities in Africa.  Every two years or so, I make a field trip to Africa where I get the opportunity to meet some of the children and adults that we together are helping.  I enjoy doing what I do and I feel really good about helping to improve the lives of others.  This means a lot to me.
