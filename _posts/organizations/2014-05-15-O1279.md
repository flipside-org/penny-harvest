  Founded in October 2009, the Brooklyn Community Foundation was established to grow local giving and attract new philanthropic resources to New York City's most populous borough, to boost the essential services and innovative programs of its nonprofit community.

  The creation of the Brooklyn Community Foundation was led by the board leadership and staff of the Independence Community Foundation, which was the largest private foundation in Brooklyn distributing over $70 million in grants from 1998-2009.
