mission: |
  The Teddy Fund was created by Martin Gross to help an employee and friend of 12 years, Stacey Parrilla and her family's enormous financial needs to provide the critical care for their son, Teddy, after losing hospitalization insurance coverage in August, for the remainder of 2005. Marty Gross and his deticated team Teri Rachuta and Robert (Butch) Miller work very hard to make each event better then before and want to see The Teddy Fund a great success.

  Teddy Parrilla has lived with a brain tumor and subsequent surgeries since birth. After 15 years of Teddy being treated and his first brain surgery at 18 months old, the insurance coverage had run out for 2005. Teddy needs to be in the hospital right now. He needs those facilities today.
