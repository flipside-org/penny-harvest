mission: |
  We incorporates all properties that front Jamaica Avenue from Dexter Court to 100th Street. We contracts with outside vendors to provide security, sanitation, and graffiti vandalism removal services within the Woodhaven boundaries. Promotional and administrative activities have been undertaken through a management consultant. Unlike the promotional and administrative activities, sanitation and security services are supplemental to existing City Services. Since 1993, City Services have been maintained and enhanced by the us.
