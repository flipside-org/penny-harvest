description: 
mission: |
  The Child Center of NY was established in 1953 as Queens Child Guidance Center, a family-focused non-profit organization. Our vision is that all children grow up to feel loved, secure and self-confident; to succeed in school and later work; and to have the sensitivity to be effective citizens of the world community. Our programs are universally dedicated to achieving this vision for the children of Queens. We are effective because we treasure the individual capacities of children and help them flourish within their families, schools, communities and cultural environment. We employ a highly skilled bi-lingual and bi-cultural staff who love children and are dedicated to their happiness and success.
