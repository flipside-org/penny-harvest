mission: |
  Women helping women provides safe temporary housing for battered women and their children. We assist victims of domestic violence to utilize social and legal services so that they might be empowered to take steps needed to lead self-sufficient lives free from violence. We network with other community organizationsto identifiy and propose solutions to family violence so that this crime will be acknowledged and fought with determination. We increase awareness of the issues surrounding domestic violence by engaging in community education with the hope of eliminating violence against women.
