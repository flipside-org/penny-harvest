  The Gerrittsen Beach Volunteer Fire Department, aka the vollies which is the last remaining volunteer fire department in Brooklyn, was organized in 1922, when Gerrittsen Beach was a small, predominantly summer community.  Before the city added water mains to Gerrittsen Beach streets, the Volunteers had to handle fires at least three times a week. The urgency of need was due to the great danger for the residents because most families had oil stoves or kerosene lamps, and the water had to be pumped from wells. Members of the department are currently known as the Vollies, and had earlier had the nickname "the Vamps." Members are not only trained to fight fires, but can also rescue people who are drowning, and assist in other medical emergencies
