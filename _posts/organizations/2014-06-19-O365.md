mission: |
  The mission of Dress for Success is to advance low-income women's economic and social development and to encourage self-sufficiency through career development and employment retention. Dress for Success responds to the needs of our communities by providing programs that help economically disadvantaged women acquire jobs, retain their new positions and succeed in the mainstream workplace.

  Dress for Success is a not-for-profit organization that offers services to help our clients enter the workforce and stay employed. Each Dress for Success client receives one suit when she has a job interview and a week's worth of separates when she gets the job. The Dress for Success Professional Women's Group <pwg.asp> program then provides ongoing support to help the client build a successful career.
