  The John P. Timlin Charitable Foundation's mission is to help families in need by giving out monetary contributions to families in increments of $500.00 to turn on utilities, buy groceries and pay medical bills.  The organization was started by the childhood friends of John P. Timlin, who was killed in an automobile accident.  These friends felt that Mr. Timlin was such a good friend to all and was very generous to the needy.  They wanted Mr. Timlin's generosity to continue even after his death.
