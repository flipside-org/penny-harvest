  West Side Campaign Against Hunger (WSCAH) helps hungry New Yorkers by providing a supermarket style food pantry, where customers in need select free food they can cook at home.  In 2011, we provided 110,000 people with food for over one million meals.  Each day we provide sufficient food for about 5,000 meals.  In 1993, WSCAH pioneered the customer choice food pantry and customer cooperative model.  We have been visited by food pantries throughout the United States, many of which have gone on to use our model.
mission: |
  Through a supermarket style food pantry, WSCAH alleviates hunger and creates a culture that promotes self-reliance and works for change. WSCAH changes our perception of hungry people by working in partnership with them, providing food with dignity and empowering customers to find solutions.

  My job is to help raise the money that funds the food we offer to our customers in need. I have not worked with Common Cents schools in the past so I am interested to see how this works.
