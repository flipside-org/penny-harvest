  Hello, Thank you for your interest in The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. As a part of the Development team here at the Foundation, I am responsible for building relationships and raising money to fund the necessary scientific research to find a cure for Parkinson's disease.  My primary focus is working with our community fundraisers in our Team Fox and MJFF - Students Give Back programs.
