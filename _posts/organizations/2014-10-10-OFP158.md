  Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people across the country; everyday, people find out that someone they know - their mother, father, sister, cousin, or grandparent - has this terrible disease. Memorial Sloan-

  Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) treats all these cancer patients - including kids who have cancer - with the best care possible. We also conduct research to find a cure, so that no one has to lose a loved one to cancer. MSKCC depends on the support of generous people of all types - including kids - to help us keep up the fight against cancer.
mission: |
  As one of the world's premier cancer centers, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is committed to exceptional patient care, leading-edge research, and superb educational programs. The close collaboration between our physicians and scientists is one of our unique strengths, enabling us to provide patients with the best care available today as we work to discover more effective strategies to prevent, control, and ultimately cure cancer in the future. Our education programs train future physicians and scientists, and the knowledge and experience they gain at Memorial Sloan-Kettering has an impact on cancer treatment and the biomedical research agenda around the world.

    Cash grants will be used to support The Children's Joy Fund of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. This fund makes sure that kids with cancer who visit our hospital have fun things to do while they wait to see a doctor. Our waiting rooms are full of coloring books and crayons, toys, games, and other items that can help sick kids pass the time. And we also hold parties during the holidays, like Halloween, so kids who are too sick to trick-or-treat can still have a good time during special times of the year.

  My name is Stephanie and I work in the Office of Development for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. What do I do in the Office of Development? Well I have several different jobs: I help people put together fundraiser events, I make sure the money from their donations goes where they want it to go, and most importantly, I say “Thanks!” So, thank you very much for every penny you can give to help out our hospital!
