  Despite the glamorous and affluent reputation Saratoga Springs has in the minds of many, as in most cities, there are also those people who struggle to make ends meet every day. The unique and comprehensive approach of Franklin Community Center fosters a sense of family for those in need, without the discomfort of bureaucratic paper work and prying questions. We offer guidance and advocacy, while providing a comfortable and friendly atmosphere. Our philosophy is to send people out the door with whatever they came in looking for. We work closely with other agencies in the area to create a user-

  friendly and effective referral system. 

  The programs and services we provide include, but are not limited to: safe and affordable housing; a food pantry; free clothing and furniture distribution; advocacy and referral information; holiday assistance; teenage pregnant and parenting educational classes (M.O.M.) and an after school youth prevention program called Project Lift. As a 501 (c)(3) private, non-profit, we rely heavily on community donations and fund-raisers to continue our efficient and effective services, which serve over 2,500 individuals each year.

  

  With a very small staff, we utilize countless volunteers and staff duties often overlap as we collectively strive to make a difference by helping others improve their quality of life with the services we provide. With continued support from the community, our goal is to continue raising awareness of the social and economic problems faced by Saratoga Springs area residents.

    Our food pantry, supported solely by community donations, is one of our most highly utilized programs. Serving more than 2,500 residents from Saratoga Springs, Ballston Spa, Corinth, Milton, Rock City Falls, Waterford, Halfmoon, Wilton, Clifton Park and beyond, the pantry relies on donations of funds and food to provide for others. Through the generosity of others, Franklin Community Center has been providing this critical service to those in need for more than 25 years. The pantry is accessible to anyone who is in need of food, without any income or residency requirement. Our motto is "a little bit goes a long way". Any donation, large or small, is helping in our mission to provide for those in need. A $50 donation can provide a holiday meal to a family of 4. A $500 donation will stock our shelves for two months, enabling us to provide food to more than 100 families each month.

    Project Lift, our after school prevention program, relies heavily on volunteers to provide positive role models for students enrolled in the program. Volunteers typically assist students with daily tasks, such as preparing snack and helping them prepare for their bus ride home, as well as assists staff with lessons and games.

    Volunteers are utilized in our administrative offices in many capacities. We often rely on volunteers to assist us with clerical tasks (such as copying and answering telephones), maintaining our distribution center, light housekeeping, yard work, snow removal, special events and more.
