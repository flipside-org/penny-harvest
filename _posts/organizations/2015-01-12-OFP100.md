  Can you imagine not being able to see? At Freedom Guide Dogs we provide Guide Dogs for the blind and visually impaired. We take the guide dog to their homes so that they can learn how to travel and get around using the guide dog as their eyes. We help people all over New York State and even other states. We want to be able to give more people the freedom to see with a guide dog.
mission: |
  Freedom Guide Dogs is a non profit organization based in Upstate New York, which offers an exciting and sensible program that provides Hometown Training with a guide dog to any qualified blind person. Freedom Guide Dog's service is available to people in the Northeastern United States. As part of our Hometown Training Program, the instructor goes directly to the home area of the blind person with his or her new guide dog. The two are trained as a team to travel confidently and safely. Emphasis is focused on those routes that the blind person will need to travel most frequently in the future

  I joined Freedom a little over a year ago. It's my job to help raise money so that Freedom can help more people. I really want to help Freedom grow because I think they do a lot of good for a lot of people and their goal is simply to reach more and more people every year. This is our third year working with the students of Common Cents and they have been a tremendous help!
