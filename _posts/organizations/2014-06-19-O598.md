description: 
mission: |
  the Humane Society of New York has been a presence in its community, reaching out to city animals when illness, injury or homelessness strikes. Today its hospital, spay/neuter program and adoption center help 29,000 dogs and cats annually, and their numbers continue to grow. The cost of caring is high and, for the Society, help is made possible entirely by its own fund raising efforts, including the charitable gifts of people who value, and choose to support its mission.
