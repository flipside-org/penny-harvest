  Thank you for your interest in the Rainforest Alliance.  I have been working for this great organization for over 10 years.  I help teachers and students learn more about the wonders of rainforests and how our daily lives are connected to them.  My favorite food that originates in rainforests is chocolate.  I wouldn't want to live in a world without chocolate!

  

  Keep up the good work!
