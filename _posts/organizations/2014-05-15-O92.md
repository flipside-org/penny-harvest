  Arcadia Bird Sanctuary and Educational Center is a shelter and we house all our birds on premises.  We do not foster out our birds, but we are a sanctuary, offering a permanent home for companion birds that are no longer suitable to be pets.  Many of our residents have been abused or neglected.  Some are elderly and deserve a 'forever' home.  Some will be adopted to the perfect family.  We never make a determination on any bird until we know that bird well.
