  Our organization exists to provide hope for the less fortunate by showing that sharing is caring. One's misfortune is not something to be ashamed of, but what you do about it is what will make the difference. We will reach out to those who need our help all they have to do is simple say, "Help!"
mission: |
  The mission of New Covenant Faith and Miracle Arena is to feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, serve the oppressed, comfort the hurting, and meet needs wherever we find them.  Since our inception in 1986, New Covenant Faith and Miracle Arena has established missions and relief programs in India, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, London, Ghana, Kenya, Brussels and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In October of 2005 when Hurricane Katrina made her devastating attack, the Gulf Coast became our newest mission field.   In October 2005 New Covenant Faith and Miracle Arena sent Bishop Adell and Dr. EnoAbasi as missionaries from our headquarters in New York to meet needs, serve and empower people to return to positions of self sufficiency.

contact_person_intro: |
  I am a passionate individual who has been working for this organization for a period of 8 years. The look of desperation and dire need on the faces of people who come weekly for food at our food pantry gives me that twinge in my heart which makes me care even more as I believe that no one should ever have to go without food. This is one of the reasons I want our food pantry to be opened more than one day per week.
