  We provide medical supplies, medical updates and supportto children who are born with a painful and isolating disease called Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)

  that causes them to get severe blisters inside and outside their bodies so that they have to spend every day of their lives bandaged like mummies to protect their skin from injuries and to heal the wounds that they already have.
mission: |
  DebRA is dedicated to finding a cure for EB, which affects 1 out of every 50,000 live births in the United States today. EB is a genetically based disease characterized by chronic, painful blistering. The skin and mucous membranes are so fragile that the slightest touch can cause severe blistering ? inside and outside the body. Present at birth, EB affects men and women of all races and ethnic groups and sometimes, when there is no family history, it occurs as the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation. Today, there is no cure or treatment for EB, except daily wound care and bandaging. Genetic research is making progress towards treatments and a cure.

  

  

cash_grants: yes
grants:

    $300. will buy a basket of supplies for a baby born with EB and will allow us to send a nurse to help the family learn how to care for their new baby to give it the best start in life possible.
  - |
    $500. will help a family pay medical bills that are not covered by insurance so that they can buy groceries and pay their rent. It costs an average EB patient $5000. per month for bandages, for that much money you could buy 20 Wii's!

    Kids with EB spend a lot of time on the computer and they would love to have pen pals from all over because a lot of them do not like to go outside because people stare at them because they look different, with their bandages and blisters.
  - |
    Some kids could do school projects on EB for a science fair, health or science class or even interview a child with EB for an English assignment to get more people educated about the disease.

  Both of my kids did penny harvest, but now they at La Gaurdia Arts HS. They loved deciding who to give their grants to. I work here at Debra because I love helping people, especially kids. Also every day here at Debra we do different things and meet new people.
