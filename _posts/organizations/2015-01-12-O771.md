mission: |
  Malaria No More uses contributions to fund proven, established bed net distribution programs throughout Africa. Each $10 gift provides a family a bed net, part of each $10 goes to help control the spread of malaria. Our students learned of the malaria problem in Africa through a social studies lesson they did in Africa.
