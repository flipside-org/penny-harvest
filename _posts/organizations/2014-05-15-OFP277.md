    Our children go to special camp near Lake Champlain, NY.

    They love it there. This year we have no funds to help us transport the children to camp. It is a 5 hour ride so we need $700 to transort them to and from "Hole in the Woods" and we also need funds to provide lunch as the trip is 5-6 hours.  Any assistance in providing help to the children so they can go to camp would be appreciated. 25 Children are going and lunch is $5 going and $5 coming home, ($250) needed.

  I have worked with St Vincent's for 20 Years. We help sick and disabled children. I try to see that the children  receive books to read. and have support at the time of the death of their parents.
