  Founded in 1979, the inspiration for Feed The Children came in Haiti through a chance meeting with a young boy who needed just 20-cents to get his only meal of the day.  Now, 33 years later, Feed The Children helps provide hope and resources for those without life's essentials in the United States and across the globe. Feed The Children provides 350,000 meals a day worldwide and provides assistance to 10 million people annually in the U.S.

    Below is an example of how cash donations and grants will help us help children around the world:  

    In The United States, every dollar you provide will be multiplied five times to help a hungry family.

    

    In the United States, our truck sponsorship program provides relief to families hit the hardest during tough times. One truck feeds 400 families of four for about a week. This truck includes 400 boxes of food and 400 hygiene boxes. We also assist disaster relief victims in the U.S. and internationally.
