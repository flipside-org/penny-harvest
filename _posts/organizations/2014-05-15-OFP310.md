  The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society is the world's largest voluntary health organization dedicated to fighting and curing blood cancers like leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and Hodgkin's disease. Through the Pennies for Patients program, we work with schools to educate students about blood cancers and empower them to make change and beat cancer. With leukemia as the #1 cancer diagnosis in children under age 20, we find that schools have been affected by a student or teacher's diagnosis and are enthused to participate because they know they are making a difference in the fight against blood cancers. Funds donated to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society go directly to patient financial support, educational programs, medical research and the development of treatments for blood cancers.

  My name is Isabel and I have been the Campaign Manager for Pennies for Patients in Colorado and Wyoming for over a year. My job is to work with schools in both states to educate them about blood cancers, inspire them with stories of our amazing Patient Heroes and support them as they learn the amazing feeling of giving back. I get to travel throughout Colorado and Wyoming visiting schools like yours where students learn that by collecting a small amount of change, they can make a big difference. I was inspired to start working for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society after I volunteered at Children's Hospital in Denver, where I met amazing kids just like you who are bravely fighting cancer. Thank you for your support!
