  Homeless people often are unable to travel and pay for the health care they need.  Care for the Homeless makes health care and medical treatment available at places where homeless people gather. We send medical teams to shelters, soup kitchens, food pantries, and drop-in centers to give homeless children, men and women free health care.

  Founded in 1984, CARE FOR THE HOMELESS, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, improves the health and well-being of homeless men, women and children by promoting healthful behaviors and providing medical, behavioral, social and shelter services. We advocate for the rights of homeless people and for public policies which support stable individuals, families and communities, and aim to end homelessness.

  I am the Development and Social Media Coordinator for Care for the Homeless.  My job is to raise money so we can give health care and medical treatment to homeless men, women, and children. I enjoy working with Common Cents because they make it possible for more homeless people to get the help they need.
