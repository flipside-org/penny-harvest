description: 
mission: |
  Provides care to the elderly. Follows a medical model day program, which is designed for persons with medical problems (including dementia) who may require one or more of the following services: monitoring, nursing care, social work, occupational therapy, physical therapy, nutritional counseling, or recreational therapy, in addition to socialization. As a result, they are significantly more expensive than social model adult day care. If the person with dementia appears to need medical model care, but does not have the income or assets to pay for it, talk to a social worker at the center about the eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which covers medical model adult day programs.
