  Metro World Child is committed to providing hope and building futures for children living in adverse conditions in metropolitan areas around the world. Whether faced with the physical effects of poverty or the dangers of gangs, violence, abuse and hopelessness, we want to see childrenâ€™s lives placed on a new path through the life-changing love of Christ. By meeting children where they are, personally investing in their lives and presenting the Gospel in a fun, accessible way, we believe we can build foundations that lead to hope, a future and better lives for children around the world.
