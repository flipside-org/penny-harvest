  Rock and Wrap It Up School Program encourages students in elementary and middle schools to help support their community through the recovery of food and other assets. Our hands-on community service projects will help support a long lasting relationship between your school and agencies in need.

  

  Students have started many of our projects.  Our "Snack Wrap Program" began in 2002 by a student in Lawarence Middle School on Long Island.  During his lunch period he noticed that many of his fellow classmates that brought bag lunches from home, would throw away excess food that they did not eat.  Many of these items were juice boxes and snacks in unopened packages.  He was aware that many of the local pantries were having a difficult time keeping their shelves stocked.

  

  He asked his principal if he could place a recylce bin in the school cafeteria and encouraged his classmates to sort out their lunch bags and make a donation to the local pantry.  At the end of each week he would make a donation of juice boxes and snacks to the local pantry and community center.  This program is still in existence and Lawrence Middle School formed a relationship with the Five Towns Community Center stocking their pantry and supplying children with snacks in the community after-school program.
mission: |
  Rock and Wrap It Up! is an anti-poverty think tank. Using greening tactics, we recover food and other assets to agencies fighting poverty, increasing their operating budgets. This allows the agencies to hire more services such as tutors, social workers, job placement counselors and mental health counselors to attack the root cause of poverty.
