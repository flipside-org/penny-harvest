    Organizing an Oxfam Hunger Banquet in your community or school is an excellent way to educate others about poverty and hunger. Few experinces bring to life the inequalities in our world more powerfully than an Oxfam Hunger Banquet. After the Oxfam Hunger Banquet, few participants leave with full stomachs, but all possess a greater understanding of the problems of hunger and poverty and how they can help.  you can access all the necessary planning materials at www.oxfamamerica.org

  Hi - I've been at Oxfam for over 10 years and love the work I do helping students and others understand poverty and hunger and then organize ways to make a difference. I look forward to working with Common Cents to help create a better world.
