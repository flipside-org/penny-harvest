mission: |
  The Mt. Vernon Animal Shelter, founded in 1974 is a municipal shelter that serves as a safe haven for thousands of domestic animals who are lost, abandoned, neglected, unwanted or in distress. We are a small shelter, but our caring staff and volunteers work tirelessly to improve the lives of resident animals and those within the city of Mt. Vernon.

  We actively promote both adoptions and fostering, and welcome volunteers.
