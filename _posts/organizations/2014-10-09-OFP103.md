  Hi, my name is Gwen Salmo.  I am the Special Events Coordinator.  I have been involved with Friends of Karen for the past 22 years, 4 years as a volunteer and 18 years working at Friends of Karen.  We help so many local children in the five boroughs of New York City and I would love to come and share their stories with you OR speak to you on the phone about the local children we help right in your own neighborhoods.   Friends of Karen has been getting Common Cents grants since 2004.  My favorite part of Common Cents is meeting and speaking to the children in the schools and letting them know all about the amazing work Friends of Karen does to make sure families stay afloat when their child is diagnosed with cancer. Last year we were fortunate to have 3 schools select Friends of Karen and give us a Penny Harvest Grant.  We used the grant money for our Family Support Program which helps families in many different ways from paying for the phone in the hospital, paying for sibling child care, paying rent/mortgage of family, paying for a family to stay in the Ronald McDonald house if their child is going to a NYC hospital, etc.  Please feel free to call me anytime to meet with your school and discuss many other ways we help to lighten the burden of families going through cancer with their child.  Please call me and let me know if you would like me to come to your school and talk to you about Friends of Karen and the children we help each and every day.
