  The goal of the Child Life Program is to help babies, children, teens, and their families during their experience in the hospital and try to make the hospital  seem less scary. We help kids understand what is going on and we provide them with toys, arts & crafts, and fun hospital parties.

    When children are hospitalized, it is often a very hard adjustment.  We like to give children a bag/small rubbermaid container with age-appropriate items when they are admitted that they can use while in the hospital and take home with them afterwards.  Baby bags contain rattles and an infant toy.  Younger kids get crayons and coloring books and a stuffed animal.  Older children get activity books and games or art activities.  Depending on the amount of money we have, bags differ in content and number of items per bag/container.  (A container is preferable to a bag because this way items do not fall out, nor do they get dirty prior to being given to a child.)  BAG/CONTAINER: Plastic container $5 OR Shopping Bag $1  CONTENTS (vary depending on age of child): "At the Hospital" Coloring book: $1.75 ea. 4 color box of crayons: $0.54 ea. Stuffed Animal: $5.00 ea. Baby rattle: $1.99 ea. Baby toy: $8-10 ea. Matchbox car: $3.99 ea. Bubbles: $0.99 ea. Activity Books: $3.99 ea. Hand-held electronic game: $13.99 - $16.99 etc.  Each bag/box ranges in cost from $8.00 to $20.00.  A grant of $1000 could make between 50-100 bags/boxes.

    The Child Life Program helps children cope with a new diagnosis, a hospital experience, a chronic illness, and/or a hospitalization.  One aspect of the program is the provision of art therapy to patients.  Art therapy is particularly useful in our treatment of pediatric patients due to the fact that children typically have limited language skills.  By drawing or using other visual means to express troublesome feelings, younger patients can begin to address these issues, even if they cannot identify or label these emotions with words.  Art supplies can be very costly and the provision of funds to keep supplies in stock would be much appreciated and needed.  Necessary supplies include markers, crayons, pencils ($150 for classroom assortment pack of all three), paper ($50), paint ($80), brushes ($30), glue ($30), model magic/clay($80), and assorted collage materials ($100).  An additional necessary supply is a multicultural blank cloth doll ($2.99 each when bought in bulk - $150)that patients can personalize.  This $650 worth of supplies can help more than 50 pediatric patients at our facility.

    We like to provide fun, brightly colored and/or cartoon character band-aids to pediatric patients at the hospital. Many children are afraid or uncomfortable with getting shots or having procedures. While we strive to provide distraction and non-pharmacological pain relief, we also like to provide an incentive program for the children. Whenever we get a new batch of band-aids, we create a “band-aid board” displaying all the possible choices of fun band-aids. Each child is shown the board and allowed to choose their band-aid before the procedure is started. The process of examining all the choices also serves as a distraction technique as the children are able to concentrate on the band-aids and not the needle. They also have something (the fun band-aid) to look forward to while the procedure is being done.  Along with the fun band-aids, we like to give each child a sticker as a reward for cooperating in having the procedure done. Children enjoy wearing the stickers on their shirts after the visit or putting them on their homemade artwork.  A potential students service project could be to have each child bring in a box of fun band-aids and a package of stickers.  The children can bring in their favorites, as the contributions are bound to be varied depending on individual preferences.

    Another potential service project for students is aiding us in making the welcome to the hospital bag. When children are hospitalized, it is often a very hard adjustment, so we like to give children a bag/small rubbermaid container with age-appropriate items that they can use while in the hospital and take home with them afterwards.    The children will purchase bins/bags and items that they think they would want if they were in the hospital. They will coordinate and fill the packages based on the age appropriate guidelines given to them by Child Life staff. Each bin/bag would be labeled by the students with the age/gender of the intended patient. All of the items placed into the welcome bags MUST be brand new. If desired, a few representatives will be able to come to the pediatric inpatient unit to distribute the packages to whichever children are in the unit that day. The date/time will be pre-arranged with the Child Life Program Coordinator. The extra packages will be given to the Child Life program that day to be distributed by staff as the need arises.

  Hi!  My name is Meredith and I have been the child life coordinator at Elmhurst Hospital for almost 11 years.  My job involves making the hospital a more fun place (and a less scary one) for kids.
