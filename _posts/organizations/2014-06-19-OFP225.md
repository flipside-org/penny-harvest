    Project Sunshine's  Kids for Kids program gives you the opportunity to put together arts and crafts kits and Surgi Dolls to send to the hospitals. Craft kits may include items to decorate a picture frame or create a journal. Surgi dolls are plush dolls given to the children during their stay at the hospital. Doctors and nurses use them to show the children what will happen during their surgery or medical procedure.

    Sunny Grams are a special note, card, or drawing to brighten the day of a hospitalized child.

    Another way to get involved is to organize a fundraiser at your school or in your neighborhood to raise money, collect new books, child friendly bandaids, and/or brand new toys which will be sent to the hospitals.

  Hi, my name is Tara and I'm a Program Assistant at Project Sunshine and I've been working here for almost two years. I love my job because I get to work with amazing volunteers (like you!) and bring lots of sunshine to kids in the hospital. I love working with Common Cents schools!
