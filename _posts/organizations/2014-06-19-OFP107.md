  When people who live with life-altering illnesses become too sick to shop and cook for themselves, God’s Love We Deliver (GLWD) delivers meals to their homes.  We feed them and their children, and we teach them about healthy eating.  In the past 25 years, we have served over 12 million meals!
mission: |
  Our mission is to improve the health and well-being of men, women and children living with HIV/AIDS and other serious illnesses by alleviating hunger and malnutrition. We prepare and deliver nutritious, high-quality meals to people who, because of their illness are unable to provide or prepare meals for themselves. We also provide illness-specific nutrition education and counseling to our clients and families, care providers and other service organizations.

  I'm so impressed with you students who give through Common Cents. What a wonderful project!  I've been at GLWD for over a year, working with foundations and corporate donors.  I am looking forward to meeting the students of the Penny Harvest.  I love to sharing your enthusiasm for helping others!
