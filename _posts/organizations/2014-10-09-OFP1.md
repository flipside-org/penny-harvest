  I would like to share with you a story about a boy named Nico.

  

  Nico lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - a large country in central Africa. One day, Nico's mother realized her son was becoming dangerously thin and could no longer go to school or play with his friends. Unsure of what was wrong with her son, she brought him to a health center run by Action Against Hunger. 

  At the health center, Nico was diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition - a very serious form of malnutrition that can lead to death if left untreated. 

  While at the center, Nico was given a special type of formula called plumpy'nut to treat his condition. After just 30 days Nico was no longer malnourished and was able to go back to school.

  

  Action Against Hunger is a global humanitarian organization committed to ending global hunger and saving the lives of children just like Nico, in over 40 countries around the world.
