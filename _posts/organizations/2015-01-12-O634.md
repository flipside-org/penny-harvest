  For a quarter of a century, Islamic Relief has worked tirelessly in countries around the world to alleviate poverty, suffering, hunger, and illiteracy.

  Islamic Relief collaborates and cooperates with local organizations in order to best cater to our beneficiaries and to maintain cultural sensitivity to customs and traditions of the regions we serve.
