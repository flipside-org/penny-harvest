mission: |
  The Red Hook Initiative works to confront and affect the consequences of intergenerational poverty through an approach that offers support in education, employment, health and community development. We believe that social change comes from within individuals. The momentum to improve the quality of life for Red Hook's residents - as well as the community at large - must come from the people living in the community. Currently over 95% of our employees live in the Red Hook Houses. We are creating a unique model for social change.
