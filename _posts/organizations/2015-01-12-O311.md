mission: |
  CPR places 100+ dogs/pups every month by transporting them from Tennessee to their new homes in New England. We also work with several NE rescue groups and shelters that assist us with placing dogs and pups in need. Since our inception in 2004, these relationships have allowed CPR to rehome more than 5,000 unwanted dogs and puppies from our area. In addition, our programs have allowed us to spay/neuter an additional 1,000. Our main focus is on helping unwanted dogs/pups from the public but we will assist humane societies and animal control facilities that reach out to us for assistance.
