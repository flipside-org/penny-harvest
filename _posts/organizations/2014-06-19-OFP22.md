  Our mission is to sponsor clinical research trials for children with Leukemia and Lymphoma and to improve the quality of life for pediatric cancer patients while they are in the hospital.  We are currently sponsoring an ongoing research project on Targeting Immunotherapy for children who have relasped at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and we sponsor parties such as gift-givings, craft making, cupcake/cookie decorating  and also a music therapist for the Child Life Center at the Hassenself Center for Children with Cancer and Blood Disorders. We also distribute tickets to the children for area events whenever possible.  We have sponsored the First International Symposium on Childhood and Adolescent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and the information gathered at the symposium has benefitted children worldwide.
mission: |
  Our mission is to raise funds for pediatric cancer research, primarily Burkitt's Lymphoma/Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. The funds will also be used to improve the quality of life for patients within other not-for-profit health facilities. Our family has the additional benefit of being able to offer other families hope by witnessing the miracle of our son, who has suffered so unbearably and has survived. We now carry all the children we met along the way in our hearts as if they were our own children and know that we must help find a cure so the pain can end.

  Hi, my name is Mrs. Gargiso and in 1997 my son, Andrew, was diagnosed with cancer.  In honor of him we established the foundation in 1999.  My son is an inspiration to everyone he meets and more importantly, he offers hope to all children with cancer and their families.  In the past few years we have carried out our mission by raising over $100,000 for children with cancer.  The first time we worked with the Common Cents Program was in Andrew's school.  He was honored and proud that his schoolmates choose to support our cause to help other children with cancer.  Since then, we have been fortunate to be chosen each year not only by our local schools but from schools  outside of Staten Island too.  It is our hope that the students will continue to support us because together, we will make a difference in the life of a child with cancer.
