contact_person_intro: |
  I am the founder of Bailey's Cafe.  The vision for Bailey's was inspired by the novel of the same name and my experiences teaching high school for 25 years.  We believe positive reciprocal relationships are key to building healthier, more peaceful communities. We believe intergenerational is better for everyone and that everyone's story matters.  We believe that the environment is to be nurtured and respected and we try to practice non violence in our speech and actions.  We use the arts and service to gather people together and to make a better place.
