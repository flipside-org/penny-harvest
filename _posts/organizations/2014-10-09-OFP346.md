  Hi, my name is Patrick Evans and I work for a great organization called World Neighbors.  I have worked with World Neighbors for 4 years Last summer I was able to visit some schools that are benefiting from World Neighbors work in Kenya and Tanzania and the differences in their lives is awesome.  I love working for World Neighbors because I know that what we are doing is saving and changing children's lives around the World.  Please join me in helping those that need a hand up this year.
