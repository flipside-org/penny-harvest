  I have been with the New York Center for Interpersonal Development since February 2010.  I am the Development Associate, which means I have to find ways to raise money so we can continue and expand our great programs.  My experience with the Penny Harvest was with my stepson's school - he was part of the group that decided where to donate the money raised at his school.
