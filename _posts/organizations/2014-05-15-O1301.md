mission: |
  The mission of The Long Beach Waterfront Warriors is to honor and aid the wounded, ill and injured veterans and their families.

  

  Here in Long Beach, New York, we have a beach whose beauty and a community whose generosity are the rival of any beach anywhere.

  

  The very least we can do for those who have offered themselves and their loved ones so fearlessly in the cause of our freedom, is to share our beach and community with them.

  

  The Long Beach Waterfront Warriors brings wounded, ill and injured veterans and their families to Long Beach for a relaxing vacation and a variety of activities. We also provide assistance to veterans hospitals and other needy and deserving institutions.
