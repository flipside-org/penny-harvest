mission: |
  Feline Rescue of Staten Island is a 501 (c)3 not-for-profit group of volunteers responsible for aiding, fostering and providing care to Animal control surrendered felines. We currently have 2 foster homes and therefore are not able to save all animals. The cats are rescued from 'high-kill' shelters ONLY and sadly, we are not able to save every animal.. All animals brought to Feline Rescue are temperament tested, brought to a veterinarian and tested for common diseases, given full vaccinations and spay/neutered. Volunteers assist in fostering and giving the cats Tender Loving Care they desperately need while they wait to be adopted into permanent homes.
