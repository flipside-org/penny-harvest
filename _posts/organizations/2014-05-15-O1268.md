mission: |
  T.O.P.S. FOR YOU, Inc., a not-for-profit, community-based resource center, has served the Bushwick community since 1980 in direct service, advocacy, referral, and community development. The Board of Directors owns its mission: "Created, owned, and administrated by the community for the community, our program aims to relieve the pressures and fears that stand between problems and solutions". Through advocacy for homeless girls, on-site Mothers' Nursery Room for infants, more than 125 licensed family daycare homes, and a full gamut of advocacy and referral services, pregnancy prevention programs, welfare-to-work initiatives, and leadership programs, our agency has proven its ability to serve the needs of at-risk families and youth.
