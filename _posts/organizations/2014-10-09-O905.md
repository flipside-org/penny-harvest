  Here at North Shore Animal League America, our mission is rescuing and restoring animals to loving homes--started by our founders , Mr. & Mrs. Alexander Lewyt, and is now carried on by our President, John J. Stevenson 

  We have been successfully placing homeless pets into loving homes for almost 60 years. It is this experience that makes North Shore Animal League America the best place to adopt a pet.
