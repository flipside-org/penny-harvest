  How many of you have a cat or a dog at home? Dogs and cats are just like us! They need food, water, shelter, doctors, and people to love them. What do you think happens to a cat or a dog that is unwanted or doesn't have a home? Could you survive without a home? Many homeless animals in New York City end up at an animal shelter that will take care of them. That's what we do! We take care of dogs and cats without homes and help them find families who will love them forever. Every penny donated to us provides food, water, and medical care for dozens of animals every day.  At Animal Haven, YOUR pennies save lives. 
mission: |
  To carefully place cats and dogs in loving homes, as well as give lifetime care for those who cannot be placed. 

  We fulfill our no-kill mission through adoption programs at our shelter <about.html> in Queens, Animal Haven @ Biscuits and Bath <biscbath.html> in Midtown Manhattan, and our Mobile Adoption Program <petspeople.html>. Animal Haven University <university.html> provides courses in positive reinforcement training to help keep dogs in their original homes.

    Pennies for Paws Sale - Hold a "sale" at your school, library, or local community center. You can sell cupcakes or candy, pencils, greeting cards (you can even make these yourself!), or anything else you can think up! When someone buys something, you give them a "Fact Card" along with their cupcake or pencil. Each "Fact Card" should tell them something important about animals that YOU want them to know. It can say: " Spaying and Neutering is the responsible choice," Chaining dogs outside is animal cruelty," "Adult cats are the largest percentage of the homeless pet population," etc. 

    OR you can hand out "See Something, Say Something Cards" that give people the name and number of the local authority to call if they witness a case of animal abuse. 

    With a Pennies for Paws Sale, you can raise money for the shelter AND teach you friends about being kind to animals.

  Hi! My name is Kendra and I do a lot of different things at Animal Haven! I run our volunteer program, supervise the humane education program for kids, update the website and handle all new cat intakes. I have been at Animal Haven since March 2008, and have visited and hosted tours for many schools. I think it's very important to teach kids about animal-related issues such as puppy mills and being a responsible pet owner.
