  Solving Kids' Cancer works hard to cure sick kids with cancer.  Cancer is a sickness that doesn't get better on its own and is the #1 reason children die.   Today, there are no treatments for the most dangerous kinds of kids' cancer that affect children here in New York City and around the world.  We work on ways to get promising medicines as fast as possible to kids that may help them get better.  We partner with scientists, doctors, and companies every day to do this work.  Every dollar we receive goes towards our goal.
