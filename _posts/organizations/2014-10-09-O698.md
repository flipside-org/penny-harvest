  The King's Inn is a private organization that is partnered with the Department of Homelessness and the Department of Education. The DOH runs the family center. They provide temporary housing and resources for families that have been displaced in times of crises. The Department of Education has workers that act as liaisons between the families and the schools. They make sure students who are living at the shelter are attending classes and staying on track academically.
