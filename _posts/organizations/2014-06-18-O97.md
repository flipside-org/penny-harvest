mission: |
  School to School gives US students a chance to give back and provide an education to South African orphans. Spearheaded by the East Woods School, in Oyster Bay, New York, Sasha Wade, Director of School to School, and Martine Tawajii, Community Service Director, have helped the children develop innovative ways of raising money. South African and US students participating in the School to School programme communicate with each other through letters and pictures under teacher supervision. This cultural exchange is having an enormous impact on the lives of all the children involved.
