  The Neediest Cases Fund <http://www.nytimes.com/neediest>, administered by The New York Times Company Foundation, raises millions of dollars to help thousands of individuals and families in distress. The assistance is rendered by seven New York City social service agencies <http://www.nytimes.com/ref/giving/neediestchar.html>. The Times pays the Fund's expenses, so all contributions go directly to provide services and cash assistance to the poor.
