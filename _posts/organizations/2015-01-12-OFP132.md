  Our foundation helps families and children affected by Rett syndrome.  Rett syndrome mainly affects little girls and takes away their ability to talk, walk, use their hands as well as brings on many health issues.  Our foundation raises money to fund research to find a cure for this disease as well as support the families who have a child with Rett syndrome.
mission: |
  The International Rett Syndrome Foundation (IRSF) was established in July 2007 through the strategic merger of the Rett Syndrome Research Foundation and the International Rett Syndrome Association. IRSF funds research for treatments and a cure for Rett syndrome while enhancing the overall quality of life for those living with Rett syndrome by providing information, programs, and services. IRSF coordinates, cultivates, accelerates, and funds research that will produce a cure for Rett syndrome and reveal and develop treatments that will make the lives of people living with Rett syndrome richer and free of pain and discomfort. IRSF also assists families of individuals living with Rett syndrome and advocates for and raises awareness about individuals with Rett Syndrome.

  Hello!  My name is Jennifer Endres and I work for a wonderful foundation called the International Rett Syndrome Foundation.  We raise money to fund research so that we can someday find a cure to end this terrible disease that affects mostly girls.  We also support families who have a child with Rett syndrome.  I have a 8 year old daughter, Jillian, with Rett syndrome.  She is so beautiful and happy yet cannot walk, talk, use her hands or even play with a toy!  Girls with Rett syndrome are smart and understand what is going on around them.  They are "stuck" inside their bodies waiting to be cured.  They all have beautiful eyes and contagious smiles and giggles.
