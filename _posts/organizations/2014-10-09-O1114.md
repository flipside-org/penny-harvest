mission: |
  Yellow Team is still out there every day helping Staten Island recover from Hurricane Sandy. With Farid & Taylor continuing to lead the way, and with the whole team rallying behind them, Yellow Team has developed relationships with other grassroots relief organizations all over the island. Theyâ€™ve even gone so far as to develop a custom app, Disaster Dispatcher <http://www.disasterdispatcher.com>, for tracking volunteers and managing resident needs. Moving forward with the best interests of local residents at the core of their approach, Yellow Team is committed to long term recovery efforts. Staten Island residents, you can count on seeing their bright yellow t-shirts for months to come!
