  Bzzzzzzzzzz! Have you ever been bitten by as mosquito? In the U.S, mosquitoes are annoying; but in many countries in Africa, they spread a disease called malaria that kills a child every 30 seconds and over one million people every year. A simple way to prevent and protect these children from malaria is to use a bed net. Bed nets stop mosquitoes from biting at night and from spreading malaria. Nothing But Nets sends bed nets to children and their families in Africa to prevent them from getting this deadly disease.
mission: |
  Nothing But Nets is a grassroots campaign to save lives by preventing malaria, a leading killer of children in Africa. While the UN Foundation has been working with the UN to fight malaria for years, it was a column that Rick Reilly wrote <http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/rick_reilly/04/25/reilly0501/index.html> about malaria in Sports Illustrated, challenging each of his readers to donate at least $10 for the purchase of an anti-malaria bed nets -- and the incredible response from thousands of Americans across the country -- that led to the creation the Nothing But Nets campaign.

    Each $10 donation to Nothing But Nets covers the cost of purchasing a long-lasting insecticide-treated bed net, distributing it and educating people on its use.   A family of up to four people can sleep under one bed net, so just one $10 donation can save an entire family!  A grant of $1,000 will provide nets to 100 families and save their lives from malaria!

    Send a message to a child or family in Africa!  Nothing But Nets  encourages its supporters to write “Message of Hope” – to families and children who will receive bed nets.  The messages can give hope and inspiration to those who are less fortunate.  You can create your own letter or fill in blank Nothing But Nets notecards, and then we will take the messages with us to Africa and give them to people who get bed nets during our next bed net distribution.

  Hello,

  

  My name is Lola Ajayi. I have been working with Nothing But Nets for almost a year now, though I have known about malaria since I was a child. I am from Nigeria, one of the many countries in Africa where children die from the disease and I grew up there until I was a teenager.  Mosquitoes have bitten me and I had malaria as a child many times while living in Nigeria because I was not sleeping under a bed net. I answer many questions asked by supporters and help them understand more about the Nothing But Nets, bed nets, and malaria. I am glad to be working with Nothing But Nets because we help save many lives thanks to our supporters.
