mission: |
  The New York State Labor-Religion Coalition is a growing alliance of unions, religious institutions, youth groups and individuals who share a commitment to challenging economic injustice. Through education, support for organizing, and advocacy the Coalition works to help low-wage workers both in New York and in developing countries to challenge corporate control. Both the labor movement and religious institutions share a long history of activism for social justice and both root this work in a fundamental respect for the dignity of each worker. We believe-and have demonstrated-that together unions and religious institutions can advance workers' rights.
