mission: |
  Francesco Loccisano, also known as "Frankie", bravely battled Osteosarcoma and Leukemia for 27 months. Through his journey, he vowed to one day develop his own foundation to make a significant difference in the lives of other children diagnosed with cancer. The journey continues with the birth of the "Francesco Loccisano Memorial Foundation". Frankie's remarkable life and his sincere and heartfelt desire to help others are the pillars, the heart and the cornerstone of this foundation. 

  We are a grass-roots organization founded by Frankie's family and friends who have pledged to remember the daily battle of children with cancer. We are dedicated to provide the support they need to face the challenges in their lives. Raising awareness, promoting research to find the cures and giving financial support to families are our goals.
