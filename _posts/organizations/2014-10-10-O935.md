description: 
mission: |
  Opened in 1988, the Food Pantry started with 2 to 3 volunteers giving emergency food once per month to about 100 people.Currently we have 10-15 volunteers who serve as many as 300 clients each week. We serve a population which consists of immigrants from Russia, Haiti, West Indies and Caribbean countries, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and several other countries.

  

  We serve every age group, middle aged, elderly, but mostly families with children; some have low paying jobs, some have no jobs, some receive food stamps, and some homeless.

  

  We do not discriminate. We give basic orientation on social services available and make referrals to various city agencies.
