  eam SCAN is a college preparatory program whose mission is to develop mature young men through the sport of basketball. Founded in 2009, Team SCAN is a program within the Supportive Children's Advocacy Network (SCAN - www.scanny.org), a nonprofit organization whose goal is to provide family assistance services and after school programming to "at-risk" youth in the South Bronx and East Harlem areas. Team SCAN focuses on holistically developing our student athletes (academically, socially and athletically) and places them in quality academic institutions at Middle and High school levels to best prepare them for college and beyond.
