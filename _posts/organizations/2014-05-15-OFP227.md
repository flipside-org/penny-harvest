    PSCH is starting a new program that will teach the people in our program job related skills.  Our hope is to purchase a mobile pet grooming vehicle.  We will use this vehicle to teach pet grooming skills to people with disabilities who love animals.  This vehicle will charge a very small fee for cleaning pets all over the Queens area.  The skills that they will learn and the pride they will gain will be invaluable.  These vehicles can range anywhere from $5000 to $80000.  However, we are looking to start small.  Your grant of $1000 will help in the purchase of our vehicle.

    A service that would benefit our consumer at our Day Habilitaton Program is art therapy.  Anyone willing to volunteer their time and sharing their gift of playing a musical instrument, singing, dancing, teaching art, etc. would greatly help the population we serve.  Our consumers strive to learn everything.
