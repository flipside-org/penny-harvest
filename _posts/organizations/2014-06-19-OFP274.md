  Spirituality for Kids (SFK) provides free outreach classes to schools and community centers that empower children to manage life’s challenges.  SFK teaches children to find their voices and to make conscious choices that end the cycle of conflict for themselves and for future generations.  SFK’s commitment is to give children the tools to realize their full potential and to help them meet life’s real challenges.

   Students participate in activities, games artwork, discussion, and music.  Each lesson builds on the next to ensure that concepts introduced in early classes continue to be refined and developed through later real-life application.  Since the best learning occurs outside the classroom, each week children are given a self-reflection exercise to think about and apply throughout the week.  Wherever possible, parents and school teachers participate in the classroom and are educated about the concepts, helping to reinforce and support the SFK learning experience. 

  “Happiness springs from doing good and helping others.”- Plato (Greek Philosopher from (429-347 B.C.E.))

  

  We currently provide programming to schools all over New York City, including The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Harlem and Manhattan.
mission: |
  Spirituality for Kids is an educational curriculum based on the ideas of sharing, cause and effec­t and the universal human truths. Regardless of personal faith, we teach the human spirit to find its individual voice and empower it to make conscious choices throughout life, beginning in childhood.

  As an educational nonprofit organization, Spirituality for Kids partners with educators, schools and organizations to teach tools to assist children in making choices to change their course and benefit future ge­nerations.

  Hello, I am Sharon. I joined SFK August 2009.  Before taking on the Volunteer Coordinator position, I had volunteered with the program and found it so incredibly rewarding on many levels.  All that is taught through SFK curriculum are tools that I use as an adult and teachings.  My experience with SFK has been one of the most rewarding things in my life.  I am very excited for this opportunity to work with the students participating in Penny Harvest.
