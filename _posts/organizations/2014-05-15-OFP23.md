  My daughter was Angela. she would have been 21 years old. She had alot of doctors that tried to help her but she only lived to be one year old. I started Angela's House to help other families. We have been helping children for more then 20 years. It is hard for parents to care for children that need medical help.It is great to help moms and dads that have a child that needs help.
