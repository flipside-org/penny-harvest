  Nearly 1 billion people don't have access to clean and safe drinking water.  We're helping change that by building wells at schools and community centers that provide water and change the lives of children and their families.  Then, we show every donor exactly where their money went.  You'll see the well you helped pay for, as it is constructed, all online.

mission: |
  The Water Project, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that's bringing relief to communities around the world who suffer needlessly from a lack of access to clean water.

  

  We cannot ignore the crisis of water scarcity throughout the world. You can help us bring clean water to Africa and India.

  

  Every day, hundreds of children die of water borne diseases. In a world with so much wealth and technology within our grasp, we can't accept that. We all must act.

    Wells for Schools:

    

    Every $20 donated helps one student get access to water for many years! So, you could provide an entire class with water for about $500.  Or an entire school could get water for about $7,000.

  The Water Project started in 2006 with a group of about 30 middle and high school students.  We set out with what we thought was a huge goal... one water project.  To date, we've funded over 450 serving more than 200,000 people.  You never know what you'll accomplish when you put your mind to it!
