  Construct Relief is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to lead the reconstruction efforts of Staten Island homes affected by Hurricane Sandy. The organization was initiated immediately after the storm to provide construction finance, management and fundraising efforts for the Staten Island, NY community. It will also serve as a hub where New York City building and design companies and professionals can register to volunteer their services or materials.
