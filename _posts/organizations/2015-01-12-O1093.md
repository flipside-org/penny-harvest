mission: |
  Originally founded in 1919 as the Queensboro Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Safe Space remains dedicated to the belief that every child deserves to grow up healthy and in a secure environment.   

  We offer a wide range of integrated family support and youth focused programs, including community and mental health services, designed to help families build a more hopeful future for themselves and their children.  Now based in Southeast Queens primarily serving Jamaica, Far Rockaway and Richmond Hill, Safe Space serves more than 10,000 individuals annually. After nearly a century, we continue our work as deeply committed as ever to our original mission:  to protect kids, keep them safe and help them grow.
