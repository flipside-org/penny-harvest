  Hi! My name is Zita, I am a teacher and I have a 7 year old nephew with cystic fibrosis, which is a fatal disease that mostly affects the lungs. Our family has created a foundation to help others understand this disease and raise funds to help find a cure for him and 30,000 other children and young adults in the US.
