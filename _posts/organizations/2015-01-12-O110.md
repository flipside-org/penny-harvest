mission: |
  For 2 days and 39 miles, everyone who has been touched by breast cancer touches you - in gratitude. Your participation - as a Walker, a Crew Member, a Volunteer or a Donor - will allow medically underserved women and men to be treated giving them access to the care they require. And hard-working research teams will be powered by the funds they need to fuel their quest for the cure.
