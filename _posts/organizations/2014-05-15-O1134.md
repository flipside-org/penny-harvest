mission: |
  Sentient Creatures was founded in 1994 to expand the work of animal rescue begun by its founder, Chitra Besbroda in 1973. Sentient Creatures is the only group dedicated to consistently rescuing Harlem's abandoned, abused, and neglected "junkyard dogs." In the 27 years since Chitra first began her rescue efforts, she has rescued and placed more than 3500 of these abused and abandoned animals in loving homes.
