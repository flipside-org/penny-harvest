  A trust has been set up to receive financial contributions.  Even with health insurance in place, the fight against these two aggressive cancers means a significant financial burden for Elisa and Nathan.  With expenses building, financial donations from you, Elisa and Nathan's family, friends, and friends of friends will be critical.
