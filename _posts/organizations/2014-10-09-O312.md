mission: |
  Our mission is to help people living in extreme poverty achieve major improvements in their lives that last and spread without ongoing support from Concern.

  

  Our role is to ensure that people living in extreme poverty are able to meet their basic needs, achieve their rights and manage their own development. We do so by working with communities and by using our shared experience and knowledge to address the root causes of extreme poverty.

  

  To achieve this mission we engage in long-term development work, respond to emergency situations, and seek to address the root causes of poverty.
