  Neighborhood Cats helps kittens and cats who are born outdoors and do not have indoor homes of their own. Because they're not used to people, these cats (called "ferals" or "community cats") can't be adopted in animal shelters. Neighborhood Cats helps them by using a method called Trap-Neuter-Return, or "TNR" to get them spayed and neutered, so even more kittens aren't born on the streets. Then we work with other people in the community to provide them with good food, warm shelter and medical care when they need it. TNR STOPS suffering and SAVES lives!

    Feral cats don't live indoors the way we do, so they need help to stay safe and warm through the cold winter months, and to protect them year-round from rainy weather. Neighborhood Cats has a program called "Gimme Shelter!" to provide shelters for outdoor cats. Every year we buy as many shelters as we can, then we give them to caretakers (people we've trained to look after the cats) all across New York City. The shelters we buy are called "Black Cat Shelters" because they're wrapped in thick, black plastic to protect cats from rain and snow. Once they're stuffed with straw, to insulate them and make them cozy inside, each shelter can keep four cats warm! One shelter costs $15 so a $225 grant would purchase 15 Black Cat Shelters, and would house and protect 60 community cats.

    When feral cats get sick or hurt, Neighborhood Cats tries to make sure they can see a veterinarian so they can get well. "Shady's Fund"is the name of our critical care fund. Shady's Fund pays for things like medical treatment for cats who are sick and need medicine, or injured and may need surgery. Many older cats stop eating if their teeth hurt so we often need to pay for them to see the dentist! Shady's Fund is important because it helps cats when they need help most. Every cat has different medical needs so the costs to treat them are different too. On average a grant of $300 to Shady's Fund would be an important contribution that could pay for exams, medicine, dental care, x-rays and other things that could save one cat's life.

    Community cats live in groups called colonies and the people who look after them and feed them every day are called caretakers. Many caretakers don't have a lot of money and it can be hard for them to buy the cat food they need. Neighborhood Cats supports struggling caretakers, like senior citizens, as best we can but there are many thousands of feral cats in New York City and a LOT of mouths to feed! Students can make a big difference for cats and caretakers in need by holding a cat food drive. Wet and dry cat food would be very welcome and would be distributed by Neighborhood Cats to NYC caretakers with greatest need.

  Hello! I love cats (and all animals) and since you're reading this, I'm sure you do too. I have the best job in the world because every day I get to help kittens and cats who are depending on Neighborhood Cats to make their lives better. I've been here for three years; before that I worked at an animal shelter that received Penny Harvest grants. It would be great to work with Penny Harvest again to help more animals!
