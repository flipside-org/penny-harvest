mission: |
  Donations to the John Hudson Dilgen Fund are used to offset the cost of medical supplies, child care clothes, and other things for John Hudson. Because of his rare skin disease, many of the over the counter antibiotics, vitamins and medications that are not covered by insurance. He also requires his own babysitter and one-on-one supervision, childcare is very expensive. John Hudson's fund is also used to purchase equipment which John Hudson needs throughout the year (air conditioners, car seats, strollers, etc.).
