  Josia Cotto was diagnosed on August 25th 2011 with an inoperable brainstem tumor called Pontine Glioma. Our six-year-old son is currently under the care of Dr. Gravin at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of NY Presbyterian/ University of Columbia. Josia has finished his Radiation Treatment and is still on Chemotherapy. This Chemotherapy that Josia is on is called Zolinza as known as Veronstat. We are facing a financial crisis but there is hope for our son, an alternative treatment in Houston Texas. This alternative treatment is proven to have a high success rate where Josia stands a 6% chance on his current Chemotherapy treatment. Our HMO and/or Private insurance do not cover this treatment. We are asking for donations to have our son treated Texas. This alternative treatment has a price tag. That price is over $100,000 for at least one year of treatment.
