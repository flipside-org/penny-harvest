  Ozanam Hall of Queens Nursing Home cares for people over the age of 65.  Many are over 100 years old!!  They need special care.  We have many pets that visit them everyday (cats, dogs, rabbits, birds and fish).  The people who work here need special education so that they can do what is best for the Residents of our Home.   We take care of 432 people!!  There are 700 people who work here and help us do it.  We are managed by a group of religious sisters called The Carmelite Sisters for The Aged and Infirm.  Thank you for considering assisting us in this great work!!!
mission: |
  Ozanam Hall is 432 bed facility, which is administered by the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm <http://www.carmelitesisters.com> . It is a facility that is woven into the fabric of the Carmelite Mission, which is bound together by the strength and guidance of Mother Angeline. Ozanam Hall was opened in 1971 in a residential community in Bayside, Queens, New York. The home is named for Frederic Ozanam, a 17th century lawyer and philosopher known for his charitable works such as founding of the St. Vincent de Paul Society. Ozanam Hall specializes in short term rehabilitation and skilled geriatric care.

    We have a large fish tank.  The fish in it have to be big so that the people who live here can see them easily.  Fish after living for many years.  To replace a large fish costs approximately $300.00.  If you replace them with smaller less expensive ones they will grow and you may visit them.

    We participated in a Food Drive for Hurricane Sandy victims.

    

    There are many plants at the Nursing Home - it makes it look like home!!  In  the Spring we like to put flowering plants outside so that the people who live here  remember when they were young.  The plants cost approximately $200.00.

  My name is June.  I was born in Brooklyn but I work in Queens.  I am a Registered Nurse.  I have worked at Ozanam Hall Nursing Home for 20 years.  That seems like a long time!!!  I have worked with Common Cents schools before.  We like to host the students who know that there is good work to be done in the community.  We have a BBQ for the class that gives us the grant.  This way you get to see where your money is going.
