  The Bedford Stuyvesant Family Health Center was founded in 1976 by the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Local Development Corporation, with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare to provide quality affordable healthcare in Central Brooklyn regardless of patients' ability to pay.   Over the years the demand for quality primary care services in Central Brooklyn has continued to grow and along with it the necessity for BSFHC to increase its capacity to serve local residents and  expand its services.  Our patient population is comprised of 84% Caribbean/African-American, 15% Latino and 1% White.
