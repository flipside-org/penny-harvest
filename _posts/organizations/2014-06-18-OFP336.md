  Uniting Against Lung Cancer (Uniting) funds innovative lung cancer research to find a cure for the nation's leading cancer killer. We also work to increase awareness of the disease, including in people who have never smoked.

  

  Since 2003, Uniting Against Lung Cancer (UALC) has awarded over $10 million to the brightest scientists in the field. Work funded by UALC has impacted currently approved treatments for many lung cancer patients and has led to a number of ongoing clinical trials testing new therapies.  Through its partners across the country, UALC is able to make critical strides in lung cancer research, improving patient treatment options and survival rates for the 226,000 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients.

    Uniting Against Lung Cancer (UALC) funds grants that allow the best and the brightest lung cancer researchers to launch innovative research projects—projects that could hold the key to a cure, projects which would otherwise go unfunded.

    Research by the Hour donation directly funds an hour of research through these crucial grants. Every hour is vital.

    Help us make even more of an impact, by sponsoring an hour or more through Research by the Hour:

    Your $25 could fund the hour when a test for early detection is proven effective.

    Your $200 could fund the day when a new treatment option is identified.

    Your $1,000 could fund the week when a breakthrough happens.

    

    o	1 hour--$25.00

    o	2 hours--$50.00

    o	4 hours--$100.00

    o	12 hours--$300.00

    o	24 hours--$600.00

    o	48 hours--$1,200.00

    If you live or work in the New York City area and would like to help, we'd love to meet you!

    Office hours are weekdays, 9 am – 5 pm ET.

    

    At Our Events

    We currently host events in states across the country and volunteers make it happen. We can put you in touch with local event coordinators so you can lend a hand. And if Uniting Against Lung Cancer does not currently host an event in your area, consider starting your own fundraiser!

    

    Start a Fundraiser

    Starting your own event is a great way to raise awareness about lung cancer and the funds so desperately needed for research. Learn more about working with Uniting Against Lung Cancer.

    

    Speak Out!

    If you are a survivor or if you have been personally impacted by lung cancer, share your story. If you are interested in being featured in our newsletter “Breathing Room” or could be a resource for journalists focusing on lung cancer, we want to hear from you. Help us to raise awareness across the country. Reach out to us today!
