mission: |
  We currently house and feed approximately 30 permanent Tourniquet residents, and provide care for 21 outside cat colonies consisting of more than 155 stray cats in the New York area.

  The work began in 1976 as a personal labor of love and soon grew into an effort so large, that to serve the need Tourniquet Inc., was formed in 2002 and registered as an official charity in the same year. At Tourniquet Inc, more than 90% of all contributions go directly to the care and feeding, spaying and medical needs of all of the animals rescued by Tourniquet Inc.
