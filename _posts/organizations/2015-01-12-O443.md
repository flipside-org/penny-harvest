mission: |
  The Franciscan Community Center exists to serve the people of Manhattan’s Upper Westside as an instrument of God’s peace. In the spirit of St. Francis, we reach out to all, in particular the poor, the alienated, and immigrant populations. We develop, manage, and support educational, recreational, and social programs that create positive change in the lives of those we serve.
