mission: |
  Founded in 1992 to respond to the refugee crisis faced by Haitian immigrants in the U.S. and Guantanamo Bay, Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees (HWHR) has provided support to hundreds of families who sought asylum in the US after being persecuted in Haiti. The organization has worked  on various relief projects, including disaster relief for Haitian victims of hurricane George in 1998, and tropical storms and hurricanes that hit Haiti and the Dominican Republic in 2004, 2007, and 2008.  HWHR had a relief program for September 11th victims who were displaced immigrant workers.
