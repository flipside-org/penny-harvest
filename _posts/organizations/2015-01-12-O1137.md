  For over 30 years, Seva has been developing sustainable global eye care programs.  Nearly three million blind people see again thanks to affordable eye care services implemented throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America.  In the past year alone, Seva-supported programs served more than 500,000 people worldwide, 25,000 children received care to prevent blindness and over 30,000 people received cataract surgery to restore their eyesight.
