description: 
mission: |
  The mission of the foundation is to build a youth community facility on Staten Island, comprised of a state of the art outdoor baseball stadium and an indoor instructional facility.  The heart of our mission is to give back to our community which has given us so much.  Joseph's love and passion were baseball.  Wherever Joseph went, he always had his ball and glove with him.  Joseph loved the community that he lived in. Although this is a community based project, the basis of the foundation is to provide athletic opportunities for children that will inspire them in a positive manner.  Our belief is that any cause that benefits children would be a worthy cause for any donor in or outside of our community.
