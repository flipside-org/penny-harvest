mission: |
  By focusing the combined talents and energy of students of the SUNY Downstate College of Medicine and of the College

  of Health Related Professions we will work to improve access to comprehensive health services for those in greatest need.  The Brooklyn Free Clinic will strive to augment existing health

  programs by expanding coverage for the uninsured and networking with other institutions to achieve a more effective

  health care delivery system. In addition we will identify issues of direct concern to our target population and work to address

  them. As the only medical school in the borough of Brooklyn we feel it is our duty to reach out to our neighbors and help ensure equitable and just distribution of vital health and

  preventive services, including health education and literacy.
