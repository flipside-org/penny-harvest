  The Blacksmith Institute is an international non-profit organization that identifies and cleans up the worlds most polluted sites. Our focus is toxic pollution, which directly harms humans, as opposed to the pollution stemming from cars. We deal with issues like lead poisoning and high levels of mercury that cause children to develop severe brain damage and learning disabilities.

    At Blacksmith, we have found cost effective ways of cleaning up toxic pollution. We have discovered that you can save a life for as little as $44. We have a number of compelling programs in places like India, Russia, Mexico, the Philippines, etc. that could use the support, regardless of amount. The thing one needs to always remember about supporting charities that work in the developing world is that your dollar goes very far.

  Hi! As the fundraising director for Blacksmith, I am in charge of figuring out ways to raise as much money as possible to clean-up toxic pollution. I organize events like golf tournaments and fancy dinners. It is a great job because you get to have fun and be creative, while knowing that you are making a difference in the world and helping to save lives.
