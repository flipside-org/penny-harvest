  Panthera works hard to help save the lives, homes and futures of wild cats.  There are 37 species, or types, of wild cats, including tigers, lions, jaguars and snow leopards. Wild cats are beautiful animals, and also important, because they help keep things in balance in the wild. 

  Wild animals all over the world are facing many threats, as human populations grow and use more and more of the land that the animals once called home.  Wild cats are especially at risk, because they are often seen as a danger to humans and livestock.  Many of them, like tigers, are classified as 'endangered,' which means that it is possible that they could die out completely.  Can you imagine a world without tigers?  

  At Panthera, we want to make sure that all of the wild cats have a safe place to live in the wild.  We do that by working to save their homes from being destroyed to build things like roads or factories.  We help protect big cats from poachers, or people who kill them illegally.  Our scientists also study the big cats in the wild to see what new problems they may be facing, like a lack of food, and to find ways to help.

    A $250 gift will support wild cats and Pantheraâ€™s conservation programs in one of the following ways:

    

    - Provides food and other supplies for a patrol team in tiger habitat.

    

    - Supports the salary of a trained scout in Africa to help track lions, reinforce bomas (corrals made out of brush to help protect livestock from lions), and protect lions from being hunted.

    

    - Provides materials to teach cattle ranchers how they can protect their livestock from jaguars in Latin America.  This, in turn, protects the jaguars from being hunted by ranchers.

    

    - Provides one camera trap to survey snow leopards in Mongolia (up to 150 traps used at snow leopard study sites)

  As a Development Associate, my job is to connect regular people who want to help big cats with the experts who are doing the work in the field.  How can regular people help?  The best ways to help are by telling others about the problems big cats are facing, and also by collecting or donating money to help the experts do their work.  For example, in order to keep hunters from illegally killing tigers in a protected wildlife park, Panthera may need to provide cell phones for park rangers, and camera traps to study the how the cats are surviving in the wild.  These things are all paid for by donations from regular people who love big cats and want to do what they can to help them survive.
