  We took a abandoned 1/2 acre community garden, and made a all natural vegetable garden. We eat what we grow. We also take all the food waste back to the garden and compost it to make healthy soil for more planting. We also hire extra gym teachers to exercise during lunch and afterschool. We also recycle all paper, plastic amd glass in the school. The children love the program.
mission: |
  Harlem Grown's mission is to increase the capacity of communities and students to access nature and green spaces, to engage these communities with nutritional and outdoor educational opportunities and improve access to a wider range of healthy foods while focusing on food justice issues. We address these goals by creating a living classroom opportunity for urban and at risk students and offering programming which allows in-need populations to learn about agriculture, nutrition, food sourcing and business.

  

  We transform abandoned community gardens and park lots into vibrant urban farms in partnership with local public schools and the community, we integrate our small farms with school curriculums thereby providing inner-city students who are traditionally cut off from access to direct experience of nature and farming a chance to learn by doing.

  Hi guys. I'm Mr.Tony, I am a full time volunteer at P.S. 175 in Harlem NY. In 2010 we turned a big abandoned lot into a natural vegetable garden, that the children take care of. Last year we grew 420 pounds of vegetables. This is my first time working with Common Cents. In New York City, we dont have many places to plant, or enjoy a park with grass and trees.
