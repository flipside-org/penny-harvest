Our services include a variety of after school programs, summer camps, preschool, swimming, sports and fitness, Jewish life programming, services for special needs and more.  We serve our community through our three locations in Sheepshead Bay as well as our new location in Windsor Terrace (www.ywindsorterrace.org).  Our staff speaks Russian, Hebrew, Chinese and Spanish.
