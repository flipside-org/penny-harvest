  Heifer International is a nonprofit organization working to end hunger and poverty and care for the earth through gifts of farm animals and training. Over the last sixty-seven years, Heifer has helped millions of people around the world, including in the US, lift themselves out of poverty. The idea is simple, and it works! Instead of giving hungry people a temporary source of food, Heifer International provides the "living loan" of an animal. A family's health and way of life is greatly improved by all of the things the animal can provide- like milk from a cow or goat, eggs from a chicken or duck, or wool from a sheep or llama. Heifer also teaches people how to care for animals and how to farm in a way that helps, instead of hurts, the natural environment. Each family passes on these gifts to another family in need, creating a chain of hope that lifts entire communities.
mission: |
  Heifer animals (and training in their care) offer hungry families around the world a way to feed themselves and become self-reliant. Children receive nutritious milk or eggs; families earn income for school, health care and better housing; communities go beyond meeting immediate needs to fulfilling dreams. Farmers learn sustainable, environmentally sound agricultural techniques.

    Chores for Change is a program that teaches students of any age about community service, the world and how to make a difference. Participants work as volunteers to reduce hunger, such as passing out food at a soup kitchen or collecting cans for a food bank. Each participant recruits sponsors to pledge donations for time spent in volunteer activities, collects the donations and sends them to Heifer International to help us fight world hunger. The experience of confronting hunger issues, firsthand, teaches lifelong lessons.
