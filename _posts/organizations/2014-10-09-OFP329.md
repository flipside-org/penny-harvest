  EdPowerment helps young people whose families have no money to get a basic education that will allow them to go on to college, vocational school, or qualify for a job.  In Tanzania, students who fail to pass the Standard 7 test (at the end of what would be 8th grade in the U.S.) can no longer attend public school.  Many of these students do not pass because they are orphaned, poor and can not attend school regularly.  EdPowerment assists these young people in two ways.  We support a small rural school where they can continue to study subjects at a high school level.  We also provide scholarships that allow the more motivated students to go to boarding school.  In addition, we support the local community through a water well project, health seminars and individual family assistance.  Our community school and center, Kilimahewa, is a place where children who have been left out of the system can go to build a future.

  I am a high school English and history teacher.  Two years ago, I took a year off from teaching and travelled to the Moshi region of Tanzania to teach and learn more about students in an impoverished society.  I became committed to helping the young people I met and their families to find a way to better their lives.  Each year I return to the Kilimahewa  on my breaks and vacations to follow the progress of the students and find out what the school and community needs to keeping improving.
