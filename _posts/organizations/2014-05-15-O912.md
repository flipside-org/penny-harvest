  Nourishing USAâ€™s mission is to help communities throughout America alleviate the strong correlation between low-income status and poor dietary health. We provide Anti-Hunger Advocacy Kits which take community groups, step-by-step, through the process of providing nutritious meals within their own communities. Anyone is welcome regardless of age, gender, race, financial qualifications, or religious beliefs.

  We encourage volunteer community advocates across the country to order a Anti-Hunger Advocacy Kit and start their own Nourishing food program, by Growing, Gathering, and Giving. With a wide spread network of volunteers and community advocates all across the nation, we can be Americans Nourishing Americans.
