  There are 10,000 kids in families that are very poor, sick and hungry in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Peru.  They drink contaminated water and eat very little food.  Most don't attend school. They live in small shacks with no electricity. At Batey Relief Alliance, we help by giving them medical care, food and medicines, clothing and school supplies.

  

  Since the earthquake devastated Haiti in January 2010, many kids have lost their arms and legs. They are suffering because they have no hospitals and medicines. They live on the streets with their families because their homes are destroyed and have no food to eat.

  

  Some kids are weak and very sick with HIV/AIDS, which is a disease that attacks the parts of your body that help you get better. They have no one to care for them because both of their parents have died of AIDS. Batey Relief Alliance gives them special care and medicines to make them feel better so they can play with other kids and go to school.

  

  A lot of these kids live in poor neighboods that are also dangerous because of crimes, drugs and violence.
