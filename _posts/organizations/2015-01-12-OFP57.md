  WE SAVED SCORES OF ANIMALS VICTIMIZED BY HURRICANE SANDY. October 29, 2012, was not a typical day for our rescue.  The catastrophic events that accompanied Sandy’s visit to the NY area, deluged us with lost animals, displaced strays from storm affected colonies,  forlorn females running for cover with their litters and sick or maimed animals that remained alone in the element, until our rescue.  In addition to the 200 animals entrusted to us daily (consisting of 30 non adoptable, feral, physically/ medically challenged permanent sanctuary residents and 170+ strays in 22 outdoor sheltered colonies, with constant rescues),  Sandy’s orphans, some 40 beautiful additional kittens and cats (we’re still counting) are now commended to our care, nurturing love and forever safekeeping.  As customary with all of our rescues,  Sandy’s victims were brought to some of our 9 veterinary hospitals asap. IMAGINE BEING HUNGRY, THIRSTY, COLD, HOT, ABANDONED FOR NO REASON, TREATED BADLY, WITHOUT A HOME AND CHASED FROM PLACE TO PLACE.  THIS IS THE SAD LIFE OF MANY OF THE STRAYS THAT HAVE BEEN RESCUED BY CATS PURRFECT RESCUE.  OVER 1,825 STRAYS MOSTLY CATS AND SCORES OF DOGS (AND ANYTHING ELSE IN NEED OF HELP) HAVE BEEN SAVED, SPAYED/NEUTERED, GIVEN THE BEST MEDICAL CARE AND HAVE BEEN PLACED IN WONDERFUL PERMANENT SETTINGS.  WE FEED AND PROVIDE EXCELLENT MEDICAL CARE FOR 200+ ANIMALS EVERYDAY!   THE NUMBER INCLUDES: 30+ PERMANENT SANCTUARY RESIDENTS (NON ADOPTABLE, FERAL MEDICALLY/PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED ANIMALS); 170 STRAYS IN 22 OUTDOOR SHELTERED COLONIES (WITH CONSTANT RESCUES AND NEW ARRIVALS DAILY).    850 ANIMALS WERE RESCUED, FROM 2009-2012, AS WE CONTINUED TO FEED AND MEDICALLY CARE FOR THE 200+ ANIMALS ENTRUSTED TO US DAILY IN OUR NEVER KILL MISSION.     I WAS A SPEECH TEACHER FOR 36+ YEARS WITH THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. THE STRAY ANIMALS THAT WE FEED AND PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE FOR EACH DAY, GREATLY APPRECIATE ANY HELP FROM THE CHILDREN OF NEW YORK!
mission: |
  We currently house and feed approximately 30 permanent Tourniquet residents, and provide care for 21 outside cat colonies consisting of more than 155 stray cats in the New York area.

  The work began in 1976 as a personal labor of love and soon grew into an effort so large, that to serve the need Tourniquet Inc., was formed in 2002 and registered as an official charity in the same year. At Tourniquet Inc, more than 90% of all contributions go directly to the care and feeding, spaying and medical needs of all of the animals rescued by Tourniquet Inc.

  HI, MY NAME IS JACQUELINE D'ELIA.  I'M A PROUD RETIRED SPEECH THERAPIST FROM THE BOARD OF EDUCATION WHO LOVES WORKING WITH BOTH CHILDREN AND ANIMALS. I TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR 36+ YEARS AND HAVE WORKED WITH ANIMALS FOR THE PAST 37 YEARS.  CATS PURRFECT RESCUE AT TOURNIQUET INC. HAS SAVED AND FOUND WONDERFUL HOMES AND IDEAL PLACEMENT FOR OVER 1,825 STRAYS. A DVD IS AVAILABLE DESCRIBING OUR SERVICES.  A COPY WILL BE FORWARDED TO YOU UPON YOUR REQUEST. OUR SANCTUARY, WHERE OVER 30 ANIMALS LIVE, IS A LOVING NURTURING HOME TO ANIMALS THAT NO ONE WILL ADOPT, EITHER BECAUSE THEY'RE SICK OR ARE FERAL (NOT TAME).  WE ALSO CARE FOR 170 STRAYS THAT LIVE IN THE STREET IN 22 OUTSIDE SHELTERED COLONIES. NEW STRAYS ARRIVE AT THE FEEDING SITES EVERYDAY AND ARE RESCUED---SOME APPEAR WITH SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND SAD STORIES WRITTEN ALL OVER THEIR FACES AND BODIES! WE CONSTANTLY SEARCH FOR EXCELLENT HOMES AND PERMANENT PLACEMENT  FOR ALL RESCUES.  IN ADDITION, WE SHOWCASE 10+ ANIMALS EACH DAY IN A PETCO STORE FOR ADOPTION. IN TOTAL, WE FEED AND MEDICALLY CARE  FOR 200+ ANIMALS EVERY DAY, IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS SAVED EACH YEAR.
