  Project Hospitality has been helping people for 31 years.  We feed people who are hungry and there are so many of them now because of the bad economy.  We give boys and girls and also men and women a place to live when they do not have anywhere else to go.  We also try to help people who are sick or who have other problems.  We try always to be kind to the people who need our help.  Also, if we did not get help from good people such as those in Penny Harvest we could not help as many people as we do.  We work all over Staten Island which is part of New York City and if you want to see what we do, just let me know.

    Project Hospitality is using its fleet of trucks and staff, including our Mobile Food Pantry, to distribute non-perishable food, blankets, personal hygiene products, and other essentials throughout the island to those who have been adversely affected by Super storm Sandy.  We have distributed gift cards, coordinated clothing drives, and a free store out of the city’s Restoration Center. Through our soup kitchens and food pantries, including our mobile food pantry, we served a total of 242,300 meals during the month of November 2012, immediately following Hurricane Sandy. We continue to provide assistance to Staten  Islanders that were impacted by the storm.

  About 20 years ago, I first saw the good work that Project Hospitality does helping people.  I started working all the time with Project Hospitality 20 years ago.  Every day when I come to work I see wonderful things being done to help others – feeding people, giving people a place to live, and especially being kind to people who may not have many friends or others to help them.  I try to get others to help us so we can do even more things for people who need help.  Thanks so much for thinking about helping us.  I hope you will.   I have worked with several Common Cents schools iin recent years.  I think Common Cents is a great idea!
