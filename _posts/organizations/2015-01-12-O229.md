mission: |
  The Cathedral Community Cares (CCC) goal is to combat and alleviate poverty through preventive poverty services – Sunday Soup Kitchen, New Hope Transitional Men’s Shelter, Crisis Intervention & Counseling Center – education and advocacy specifically targeting the issues of homelessness and hunger. CCC simultaneously tackles these problems on multiple fronts by addressing the immediate and beyond-emergency needs of the underserved while seeking long-term policy solutions that will benefit both clients and the greater community. As a part of "the living Cathedral," CCC operates, coordinates and expands its direct service programs and advocacy campaigns based on the ever-unfolding, diverse needs of the community while fostering self-sufficiency and cultivating social justice through outreach, education, intervention, and empowerment.
