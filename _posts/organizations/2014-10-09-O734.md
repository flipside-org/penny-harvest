mission: |
  The GRYC Little Stars Pre-K program services 4-year old children, by providing NYS mandated Universal Pre-Kindergarten.Currently, we have four classrooms and three sessions for a total of 9 UPK classes and 162 children.The classes have approximately 18 students each. We teach children according to developmentally appropriate practices as mandated by the NYC DOE Pre-Kindergarten Performance Standards. We focus on promoting the development of the children cognitively (academically), physically, emotionally and socially. To achieve these goals, we follow the Creative Curriculum for Pre-School by Dodge, Colker and Heronman, in a carefully planned environment. Literacy is a part of our learning environment. Multi-cultural and multi-lingual children come together and learn English through play and social interaction, without pressure. We lay the foundation for all their future learning.
