  There are over 12.4 million hungry children in America.  Every day, almost 16,000 children across the world die from hunger-related causes.  At WhyHunger, we believe that nobody should be hungry, especially when there is so much food available.  

  In our fight to end world hunger, WhyHunger does three things:  First, we answer calls to the National Hunger Hotline, which tells people who are hungry where they can find free food.  Second, we help people who are hungry get an education, find jobs or find childcare so that eventually they can work and earn enough money to buy food.  Finally, we try to make the world more fair so that people won’t be hungry in the first place.  For example, WhyHunger tells big supermarket companies that they should sell fresh fruits and vegetables in their stores that come from nearby farms.  This would mean that healthy food is available at affordable prices to everybody.   

  WhyHunger was founded in 1975 by the late singer, Harry Chapin, and Bill Ayres, who is our current Executive Director.

    Every year over 18,000 individuals, children and families call WhyHunger’s National Hunger Hotline looking for food and other services in their neighborhoods.  It costs WhyHunger $20 to answer one phone call.  A grant of $100 would allow WhyHunger to answer 5 phone calls in one year; a grant of $500 would allow WhyHunger to answer 25 calls; and a grant of $1,000 would allow WhyHunger to answer 50 calls.

    Every year, WhyHunger helps 8,000 food banks, soup kitchens and other organizations to provide better services to people that are hungry.  WhyHunger helps by giving information, organizing events and connecting organizations to funding.  It costs $30 for WhyHunger to provide this services to one organization.  A grant of $300 would help WhyHunger provide support to 10 organizations in the United States.

  My name is Kelly and I have worked for WhyHunger for 4 years.  My title is Development Director – that means that I am responsible for spreading the word about WhyHunger, raising money to help end hunger and poverty in the United States and around the world.  I am really excited to work with Penny Harvest schools this year because I used to work as a teacher in NYC public schools and miss working with kids!
