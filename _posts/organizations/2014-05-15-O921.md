mission: |
  Ollie's Place is a non-profit, no-kill animal rescue organization whose ultimate goal is a permanent loving home for every adoptable animal.

  

  An animal's life, both physically and emotionally is precious. They develop strong feelings for humans, they bond quickly and are heartbroken when rejected, returned to a shelter, or worse - turned out on the street. Too often people make a split decision to adopt a pet, and that animal will have to live with that person's decision for the rest of their lives. So when you see that pet who looks really cute, and you just can't wait to take him or her home, think first about how much he or she may have already suffered in life. Make sure that you adopt a pet for the right reasons.
