  Hi my name is Luis.I loved life. I like to dance, sing, play baseball, basketball and video games.  I was living life to the fullest and excited about starting school in the fall.  In summer of 2009, I became sick with a fever and achy bones. I was very fatigued and the doctors thought I had a virus.  By September 2009, I was diagnosed with Leukemia. The type of Leukemia I have is Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (also known as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or ALL). The type of cell it affects is the Pre-B cell. Treatment for this type of cancer includes chemotherapy for 3 1/2 years and if this fails I need a bone marrow transplant. I will not let this disease take over my life, instead I will use this to help myself and others by making the world aware about Leukemia, my struggles with this disease, how it affects patients families, and the importance of becoming a bone marrow donor.
