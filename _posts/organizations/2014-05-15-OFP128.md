  Hope For The Warriors honors and supports wounded US service members, their families and the families of those that have died in combat action in Iraq and Afghanistan.
mission: |
  The mission of Hope for the Warriors™ is to enhance quality of life for US Service Members and their families nationwide who have been adversely affected by injuries or death in the line of duty. Hope for the Warriors™ actively seeks to ensure that the sacrifices of wounded and fallen warriors and their families are never forgotten nor their needs unmet, particularly with regard to the short and long-term care of the severely injured.

    Hope For The Warriors has numerous opportunities that students can fund. Our Immediate Needs program understands that many military families are in need of important financial assistance. Students could fundraise to purchase grocery store or visa gift cards to help alleviate financial burdens placed on the family. Range: $50.00-up
  - |
    Students can also fundraise for wounded team members. Hope For The Warriors understands the importance for many wounded service members to continue to train and race (competitively and non-competitively) and we currently have a waiting list for adaptive race equipment (handcycles). Students could be matched with a wounded service member on our waiting list and fundraise to fulfill their dream of owning a handcycle. Handcycles cost around $3,000.00, but students could support the purchase with a donation of $50.00 and up.

    There are numerous races that we hold in the NY, NJ and CT area to raise money and awareness for wounded service members, their families and families of the fallen.  Students can volunteer to assist with race set up and break down as well as man a cheer section or water stop.

    Students are encouraged to be creative. We have had girl scout troops provide baked goods for one of our events. We have even had track teams come out to run in one of the races, or an entire school fundraise for one of our programs. There are also opportunities within the NY office for students to help with administrative tasks.
