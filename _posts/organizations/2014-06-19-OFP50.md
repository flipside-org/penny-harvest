  My name is Robert Vazquez, I have been the Kennel supervisor, as well as the dog behaviorist, trainer and caretaker. I have been at BARC the last 11 years and have helped over 1000 dogs and cats find homes in Brooklyn. I also help educate the public about the necessity of adopting from a no-kill animal shelter.
