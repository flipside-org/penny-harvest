  Rock 'n Renew is a non-profit organization that helps students, businesses, activists, artists, and musicians live and act in sustainable ways. Recognizing the connection between the health of culture and the health of the planet, we use music, art and science to generate excitement about green solutions as we custom-design eco-blueprints for schools, businesses, and communities.
