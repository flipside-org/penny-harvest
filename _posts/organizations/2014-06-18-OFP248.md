  Rockaway Artists Alliance, Inc. (RAA) is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) arts organization headquartered on the Rockaway peninsula.  RAA artists work in many disciplines and reflect the cultural diversity of Queens.  Its members believe that the arts are essential to one’s education and are vital to the health of a community.  RAA in partnership with Gateway National Recreation Area (GNRA) and the Rockaway Theatre Company (RTC) has established an Arts Center in scenic Fort Tilden, Rockaway, Queens.  RAA’s mission is to encourage and engage residents of its community, particularly its youth and seniors, in the arts and cultural activities.  These facilities act as a magnet to artists and visitors from all over the city and beyond.  The Rockaway Center for the Arts (RoCA) is the last piece of the cultural corridor that extends from Manhattan through Queens to the Atlantic Ocean.
