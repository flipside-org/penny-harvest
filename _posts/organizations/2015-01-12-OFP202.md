  I work with the internal and external fundraising programs for The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Northeast New York.  I work with people who want to raise money and/or donate money to fund the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions.  I work within the 15 counties in the 518 area code - which enables me to help people help children that live right in their community.  Often I can tell the fundraisers or the donors who recieves the wish that they money was donated for or to.  People like to put a name and a face to the people they are helping.  The wishes don't just help the children - they really help the entire family; wishes give the entire family a break from the medical visits.  I have been doing this for four years and it is very rewarding - not just to help the people (children and thier families) but to get to meet the donors or groups like schools who are raising the money that is donted.  I have worked in the last 12 months with two schools that have done a Penny Harvest Campaign.  Each time I have been very impressed and honored to get to share in the experience.
