  I am Pastor Tim McIntyre, the lead pastor and founder of Oasis Christian Center.  I have been pastoring Oasis since it began in February of 2004.  In 2006, we opened The Oasis Life Center in Midland Beach.  The Life Center was created as a community outreach in an effort to meet the needs of the Midland Beach Community.  Our weekly emergency food pantry is open on Tuesday evenings from 7:30-8:30 p.m.  A photo id and proof of address are necessary to receive free groceries.  The Life Center also hosts other events geared toward children and teens.  They are announced as they are scheduled.
