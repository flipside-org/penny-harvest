description: 
mission: |
  To serve and support all people by bringing smiles, joy, love and laughter to those who have been impacted by a catastrophe. To provide guidelines and train volunteers to work effectively with other humanitarian organizations while administering a unique form of comic relief. After a natural or man-made disaster, we mobilize teams of trained clowns to travel to affected regions to provide support and smiles to survivors and relief workers. For those who do not perform, they are provided with equally essential roles in areas such as fundraising and operational support. In regions outside of those directly impacted by the tragedy, specialized activities address the far-reaching emotional impact.
