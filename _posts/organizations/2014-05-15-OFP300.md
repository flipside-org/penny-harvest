  Riverkeeper protects the Hudson River and the water that you drink. Riverkeeper believes that every person can make a difference, and that it is our job to protect the environment, starting with the clean water needed by both humans and wildlife to survive. That's why Riverkeeper uses a patrol boat to travel between New York City and Waterford, 150 miles north, to prevent pollution of the Hudson River.

    Did you know that water isn't always safe for swimming? Riverkeeper tests the water so that people will know when and where water is safe--and where it is not safe. $15 pays for one water test in one location. $1,000 pays for a month of water tests on the whole Hudson River.

    It costs $500 for the fuel for the Riverkeeper patrol boat to patrol the length of the Hudson River, about 150 miles. For $33 you can purchase enough gas to patrol 10 miles.

    Each Spring, more than 1,000 people volunteer as part of the Riverkeeper Sweep, our day of service for the Hudson River. You can help by picking up trash at a park near you to keep garbage away from the shoreline and out of the water! Find more information at http://www.riverkeeper.org/sweep

  I grew up near the Hudson River, and I've always loved wildlife and the outdoors. When I learned that the river is an estuary, connected to the Atlantic Ocean, I was fascinated. It is not only beautiful, but full of interesting wildlife, like the Atlantic sturgeon, which can grow to over eight feet and weigh more than 200 pounds! But because people have polluted the river for many years, not all our wildlife is healthy, and we can't even safely eat fish that are caught in the Hudson River. Riverkeeper works to make all water safe for swimming, fishing and drinking. I want that too. That's why I work here.
