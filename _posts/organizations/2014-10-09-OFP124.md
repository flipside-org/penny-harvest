  Hi! My name is Sarah, I've been working at Homes for the Homeless for about six months as a Program Associate which means that I work with the program staff that run our American Family Inns. Homes for the Homeless also operates summer camps for homeless and low-income children at which I worked as a counselor for three summers! I also help to organize donation drives and seek cash grants for the programs in our shelters. I also help plan fun activities for the children who live in our shelters. We help families get back on their feet and make sure that the children living in our shelters go to school and have a safe place to play and study after school.
