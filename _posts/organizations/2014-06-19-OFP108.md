  Greenproofing works with students and people in the neighborhood to improve the environment. We work on planting more trees, plants and flowers in the city. This helps to improve the air we breath and our oceans and rivers. When children and adults work with us they learn more about the environment and they are helping the environment at the same time.

    Greenproofing would use funding to develop a new garden near a school, P.S. 161 in West Harlem. This garden could grow vegetable plants that could be eaten by the students and people in the neighborhood that help care for the garden. The area has only a few trees and gardens. 

    We hope that this space will be special to the children and adults in the area, help the environment by adding plants and soils that help to clean the air and rain water 

    The garden could be used by students as an outdoor classroom. The garden would show children and adults how plants, insects and birds are important to our environment. 

    The garden would encourage others to plant gardens and create more green spaces to benefit the environment and people. 

    We are asking for a donation of $1,000 to purchase supplies and pay an adult to help with some of the heavy work such as digging and putting up a fence. Budget 

    Box Planters - $600

    We will install 10 large box planters made from recycled wood, concrete or metal (approximately 4 feet by 4 feet).

    Each planter, including the soil, seeds/ seedlings, and boxes will cost $60 each. 

    Education Materials 5 Posters/ signs - $50

    500 Bilingual Booklets - $350 

    We will create posters/signs and small booklets written in English and Spanish to educate the community about the importance of gardens and trees for the environment. And to announce all of the events that will be held in the garden. Including classes and workshops on gardening, tree care as well as the weekly farmers market that will be held in the garden.
