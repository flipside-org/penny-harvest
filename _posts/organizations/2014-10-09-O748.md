  Loving Touch is an all volunteer, non-profit 501 (c ) (3) organization. Our mission is to help homeless animals find a better way of life and help find new homes for pets that owner's can no longer keep. To prevent the birth of unwanted homeless animals by spaying/neutering every animal that we rescue. To provide medical care for each of our rescued animals. To educate the public in all aspects of pet care and responsibility. To provide a loving and safe environment for each of our rescued animals until a suitable home is found.
