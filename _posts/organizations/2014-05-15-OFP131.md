  Because of poverty and the HIV/AIDS pandemic (which is when a lot people have the same very bad disease), one in every five children in South Africa is lonely and hungry and doesn't have a parent or other adult in their lives to help them.  Thanks to computers and webcams, adults anywhere in the world, like your mommies and daddies, can see and talk to them every week.  This way, South African children get to have a special aunt, uncle or teacher like the one who cares about you and helps you every week.
mission: |
  American adults (“Net Families”) overcome geographic, cultural and economic barriers and directly affect the daily life of African children (“Net Buddies”) by mentoring them via videoconference and the Infinite Family secure internet site. Together, we can offer African children the technology, guidance and tools to grow into strong and successful adults.

  My names is Amy Stokes and I am the Founder and Executive Director of Infinite Family.  Infinite Family was started after I adopted my son from South Africa in 2003 and learned about how many children there do not have families.  I am so excited to have received our first grant from the Penny Harvest and hope we can work with many more of you to help you learn about Africa.  Thank you for caring about Africa's kids too!
