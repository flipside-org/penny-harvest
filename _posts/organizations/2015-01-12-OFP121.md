  Imagine not being able to read your teacher’s notes on the chalkboard, or having to squint your eyes to read a math equation on the overheard projector.  For many children your age this is common.   Unfortunately, there are tons of kids in New York City (and around the country) whose parents cannot afford a trip to the eye doctor or a pair of glasses to fix this.

  

  The good news is that ChildSight® goes into schools to test the vision of students in need, and if they have vision problems, provides them with free eyeglasses.  This means these same students who were squinting and couldn’t read the chalkboard will now be able to see clearly and focus on their school work.

  

  ChildSight® is the domestic program of the international non-profit, Helen Keller International (HKI).  HKI works around the world to prevent blindness and reduce malnutrition.  In the US, HKI’s ChildSight® program screens over 100,000 students and provides approximately 20,000 pairs of eyeglasses to students each year.

    $400 will provide 16 pairs of FREE eyeglasses to NYC middle school students who are in need (this equals about $25 per child).  These students will receive a vision screening to determine their need, and then an eye doctor will examine them to figure out their exact prescription.  After they pick out frames they like, in 2 weeks a brand new pair of eyeglasses will be delivered to them at school!

    It’s a very exciting day when students receive their new eyeglasses from ChildSight®.  While all students are excited to see clearly, some are a little shy about having to wear glasses.  To encourage them to wear their glasses with pride, Penny Harvesters could draw pictures and/or write cards telling these students how cool their new glasses are and welcoming them to a world of clear vision.

  Hi, my name is Stephanie.  I have worked for Helen Keller International with the ChildSight® program for more than 2 years.  My job is to raise money so that ChildSight® can continue to provide kids with glasses.  My favorite part of my job is hearing from students who had their vision corrected through ChildSight®.
