  I am one of the original founders of A.F.E.W. which was started in 1993.  We have helped many dogs and cats, even horses, geese, pigs and hamsters.  All living creatures need a friend and that is what we try to be to them. Someone to help the homeless ones, the injured ones, and sometimes just the sad, lonely ones.
