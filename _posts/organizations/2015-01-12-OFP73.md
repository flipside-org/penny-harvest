  The Cypress Hills Child Care Corporation (CHCCC) was founded in 1990 by concerned community women in response to a pressing need for quality child care and stable employment opportunities for women interested in capitalizing on their child rearing skills, and operating their own business. We have since established a Family Day Care Network with 50 Family Day Care providers caring for approximately 425 children, a Head Start Family Day Care program serving 70 children and their families, and an ACD funded day care center caring for 70 children ages three to five. The Cypress Hills Child Care Corporation has an open door policy and services community members need of child care. These services are important in our community because by having child care the community residents can work and earn a living to support their families. 

  In response to Cypress Hills/East New York's most pressing health needs: obesity, asthma and other ailments, the CHCCC established an annual health fair (every year) that allows us to bring together health care professionals, and community service providers to provide health screenings and information; in addition to a  variety of children activities to Cypress Hills/East New York residents.

    Every year, at our annual health fair, we bring together more than 30 community organizations to provide information, health screenings and children activities to the public. But as we reach out to more people, the cost of the health fair increases. Any money  given to us for this project will be used to pay ($200.00) for food (sandwiches) and/or bottled water for hungry participants of our health fair.

    The Cypress Hills Child Care Corporation also keeps a food pantry at the office and distributes groceries and supermarket food certificates to hungry community residents. Although we were not directly affected by Hurricane Sandy, there are a great number of Cypress Hills residents who lost jobs due to Hurricane Sandy, and are thus undergoing financial harship and are unable to purchase adequate healthy foods to fee their families . Any money obtained under the penny harves project will go towards helping  Cypress Hills residents  (program participants) who lost their job due to Hurricane Sandy Specifically,  those who had jobs in the flood zone areas around the city.
