  Alternative House -- The Abused and Homeless Children's Refuge provides support for at-risk children, youth and families through counseling, shelter and crisis intervention.  Our programs include: the Emergency Shelter for Teenagers, which is a short-term shelter for teens in crisis; AYM (Assisting Young Mothers), which is a residential facility for homeless pregnant and parenting teens and their children; and Community Outreach, which offers after-school programs and street-based support to help kids stay in school and away from gangs and drugs.
mission: |
  Alternative House exists to provide help to children, teenagers, and their families. Beginning as a small runaway shelter for teenagers in 1972, Alternative House has evolved into a significantly larger organization and system of services designed to respond to the changing needs of today's young people.

    A one-hour counseling sessions costs $90 so a $1,000 grant would cover 11 counseling sessions.  We provide individual counseling weekly for each young person.

    One meal for youth in any of our programs costs $4 so a $500 grant would provide 125 meals.  That would cover 2 weeks of dinners at one of our programs.

  As the Development Director I represent Alternative House in the community often speaking about our programs and services. I visit community groups and schools to tell people about Alternative House and how they can get involved. We have a Teen Shelter, AYM (Assisting Young Mothers) home, and after-school programs.
