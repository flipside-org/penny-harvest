  Started at the suggestion of a 5-year-old boy in New York City , The New York Says Thank You Foundation sends volunteers from New York City each year on the 9/11 Anniversary to help rebuild communities around the country affected by disasters. 

  This year, we made a promise to help rebuild 200 homes of NYC First-Responders (FDNY/EMT, NYPD, DSNY and volunteer firefighters) affected by Hurricane Sandy. As of March 19th, we have helped rebuild 29 homes - 171 more to go!

  We would love to have the NYC School kids support in getting these brave men and women & their families back home!

  The mission of The New York Says Thank You Foundation is to send volunteers from New York City each year on the 9/11 Anniversary to help rebuild communities around the country affected by disasters. It is our way of commemorating the extraordinary love and generosity extended to New Yorkers by Americans from all across the United States in the days, weeks, and months following 9/11.

    The 9/12 Generation Project is the ten-year, national service-learning initiative of The New York Says Thank You Foundation, which brings together community revitalization, disaster relief, and the arts. The focus of The 9/12 Generation Project is to explore the Nation’s reaction to the 9/11 tragedy - on 9/12 - and to inspire and educate 1.5 Million middle school and high school students with the timeless, universal, and positive lessons of citizenship, volunteerism, resilience, and compassion that emerged from 9/12. Our goal is to leverage an educational version of the New York Says Thank You film and our nationwide base of first responders and volunteers in order to engage students at 2,800 middle school and high schools nationwide in a meaningful discussion about the compassion of the American people following the 9/11 tragedy and to activate these students in hands-on volunteer projects directly related to the “pay it forward” ethic at the core of The New York Says Thank You story.

    We can have children help paint Stars of HOPE, a unique volunteer organization that empowers children

    to transform communities affected by disasters through the creation of colorful and inspiring art.

    Hand-painted Stars of HOPE include inspirational words, messages, and designs created by children from nursery through high school. These

    simple gestures transform physical landscapes and emotional despair of devastated areas into communities of hope and progress.

  Hi. My name is Jeff Parness and I started The New York Says Thank You Foundation after my 5-year-old son Evan told me he wanted to send his toys to children who lost their homes in the California wildfires a few years ago. Each year, we send volunteers from New York, including New York City firefighters, to help rebuild communities around the country that suffered major disasters like wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes. It's a really cool way to show people around the United States that New Yorkers care about them, and that kids in New York care enough to raise money to help them rebuild. 

  Plus, if your parents want to come along with you on any of our rebuilding trips, it is really neat to have the chance to build homes and other buildings alongside real New York City firefighters in places like cornfields in Indiana!
