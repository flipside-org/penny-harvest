  For Our Friends is a dog rescue group. We rescue dogs from the streets and from the city shelters where they are in danger because of overcrowding. We provide every dog with the medical attention they need. This is one of our biggest expenses. We find every dog the loving "forever home" that is best for them. For instance, we rescue many older dogs and place them in homes of retired, mature people. We spend a lot of time interviewing new owners so that we can place every dog in the best home. We also spend a lot of time training and getting the dogs ready for their new homes. We help people that can no longer keep their dogs find new homes for them by putting them on our website. We are an all volunteer group and every penny donated goes directly to rescue more pets, nobody receives a salary. Recently we have rescued several dogs that have lost thier home because of Hurricane Sandy.

    $200 is enough money to allow us to rescue one dog (save one more life) and give it the medical attention it needs. It will also pay for the first week boarding (we have no shelter of our own and must pay to board our dogs). There is always a waiting period of one week for us to get to know the dog before we place it up for adoption. This way we are sure that the dog is healthy and we can judge the best home to put him in.  We have also resuced and foun homes for dogs that were lost as a result of Sandy.

    This year we have rescued several dogs that have lost their home because of Hurricane Sandy. We have been able to reunite some of these dogs with their owners but there are several whose owners could not be found. These dogs are now up for adoption and we will place them in loving homes. Some of these dogs were rescued from our muncipal shelter because they were overcrowded and some were found as strays. Blizzard is one wonderful Husky mix whose owner we could not find. Blizzard is 7 years old and he was so afraid. He had a collar but he had no tags. We searched for his owner but now Blizzard has been adopted and he is not afraid anymore. He has become a very happy dog, secure in the love of his new family. This is just one of the dogs we have rescued. There are many more stories I would love to tell you about.

  I have been director of For Our Friends for about 10 years, before that I just worked with the dogs. We2rescue mostly stray dogs and we find them good homes. We have to interview and talk to many people to find homes for our dogs. We also walk and train the dogs to get them ready for their new homes. The dogs are all so grateful to be given another chance to find happiness with their new families.
