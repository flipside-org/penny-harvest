  Hi. Thanks for participating in this awesome Penny Harvest program! At DVRC we've been helping adults and young people understand unhealthy relationships and create healthy ones for 30 years. Specifically, we help reduce teen dating violence and bullying. We received an award in 2013 to support our anti-bullying program and are thrilled (to be able to continue it, because of you!).
