mission: |
  Our mission is to ensure the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide. The fight against hunger is one of the greatest challenges facing the world over the coming decades. Crop diversity is fundamental to defeating hunger and achieving food security. But it is at serious risk. And there is only one organization working worldwide to solve this problem - the Global Crop Diversity Trust. The Trust's response is to raise a $260m endowment, the interest from which is enough to guarantee the effective conservation – and vitally, the ready availability to those who wish to use it – of the biological basis of all agriculture. The endowment will ensure that the conservation of this most critical resource is placed forever on a firm foundation.
