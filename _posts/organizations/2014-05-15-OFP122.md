  The mission of the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen (HASK) is to feed the hungry, to comfort the afflicted, to seek justice for the homeless, and to counsel and provide a sense of hope and opportunity to those in need.    HASK’s Emergency Feeding program provides hot and nutritious meals every Monday through Friday from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. HASK’s Counseling and Referrals Services provides assistance typically for shelter, clothing, food pantry, alcohol and drug rehabilitation, AIDS prevention and treatment information, employment, and for obtaining public benefits.    A majority of our clients (guests) are homeless and jobless African-American and Hispanic men, aged 18-44.   In 2004 HASK served more meals than in any single year of our 22-year history -- 296,505, or an average each weekday of 1,132! Our Counseling and Referrals (C&R) Services also served a record number in 2004 when we held 5,016 information, counseling and referrals sessions.

    We will use cash grants to help cover the general operating expenses of our Emeregncy Feeding and Counseling and Referrals programs. Typical operating expenses are those for fresh produce, frozen food, meat, staff, equipment repair and maintenance, consumable and cleaning supplies – all essentials to our operation. The daily meals and the counseling and referrals we provide are life saving for huge numbers of guests we serve.

    Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen lost power for a week after Hurricane Sandy, and we mobilized staff and volunteers to serve sandwiches curbside. Although we are not offering specific programs for those who have been affected by Hurricane Sandy, they are always welcome to the Soup Kitchen. In addition to offering food, we can direct those who have been affected by the hurricane to the appropriate social services.

    We offer the opportunity for small groups to volunteer to help us with our daily Emergency Feeding program. These volunteers provide assistance such as greeting the guests, collecting the numbered meal tickets given out to those waiting on line, serving food and beverages, refilling water and milk pitchers, clearing the tables, and listening to guests talk about their lives.   We do ask that groups make prior arrangements with our Volunteer Coordinator. Volunteers need to report (weekdays only) by 9:45 for volunteer service that ends at 12:30. Lunch is provided afterwards.
