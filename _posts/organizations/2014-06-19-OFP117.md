  Can you imagine a more perfect summer day than reading books, playing baseball and HAVING FUN? Well Harlem RBI provides a safe place where East Harlem kids can do all three! Harlem RBI provides inner-city youth with opportunities to Play, Learn and Grow by using the power of teams to coach, teach and inspire them to recognize their potential and realize their dreams. Harlem RBI serves more than 1,000 inner-city boys and girls, ages 5-21, and all programs are free and open to all participants.
