  Culinary Kids sole existence is to help feed our community at large with more healthy organic fruits and vegetables at a price that low-income residents can afford!
mission: |
  Our mission statement is to assist and empower the youth in low-economic areas in healthier, more nutritious eating habits which will produce more self sufficient adults economically. Through our programs, the youth will be able to not only learn about healthier eating but to also learn about how to

  become economically sufficient through Culinary Arts, Farming and Agriculture.
