mission: |
  The Lulu & Leo Fund was founded in November 2012 by Kevin and Marina Krim in memory of their children, 6-year-old Lulu and 2-year-old Leo Krim, who were killed in October 2012. The goals of the Fund, which it intends to achieve by working with museums, schools and other community institutions, educators and artists, are to create, fund and promote extracurricular arts and science programs for students who would not otherwise have access to programs of these types.
