  Many kids in New York City don't get enough food to eat and can't pay attention or learn in school because their stomachs hurt.  But the Food Bank For New York City helps hungry kids of all ages, their families and friends get free food by providing food to over 1,000 community and emergency feeding programs throuought the five boroughs. With your help collecting pennies we can help feed the over 1.5 million New Yorkers who are hungry. With every dollar you donate, we can provide five healthy meals to our neighbors. Before we can nourish our minds, we must first nourish our bodies and the Food Bank For New York City is here working to end hunger in our city.

    School groups can hold food drives to collect shelf-stable (canned and boxed) food which we then distribute to soup kitchens and food pantries throughout the five boroughs of New York City. Students must be at least 14 years of age to enter the warehouse and re-pack food.

  Hi, my name is Lee Cheney. My job at the Food Bank for NYC is to help raise food and funds for our neighbors in the 5 boroughs. I have been a "food banker" for a total of 5 years and am passionate about the mission to help provide food to the people of our community who are food insecure. I am new to this organization, but the Food Bank for NYC has been a friend of Common Cents for approximately 6 years. I am excited to be on board and help educate and engage all of you!
