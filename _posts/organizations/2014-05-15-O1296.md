  Welcome to the Jessie Rees Foundation.

  A pediatric cancer foundation inspired by 12 year old Jessie Rees. Jessie was a beautiful, athletic, smart and compassionate girl who fought two brain tumors (DIPG) for ten months and two days. On January 5, 2012 Jessie earned her angel wings.

  During her courageous fight, Jessie focused on spreading hope, joy and love to other kids fighting. She knew having cancer made you feel lonely and limited so she chose to spread love stuffed in her JoyJars®. JoyJars® have now become a recognized symbol of hope, joy and love in over 200 Children’s Hospitals, 175 Ronald McDonald Houses and 11 countries.
