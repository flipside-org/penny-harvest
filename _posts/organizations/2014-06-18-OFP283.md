    We always need money for our Shipping cost. Everyone on our list gets their own individual box. If there is alot in a unit, we send several boxes so they can share the goodies. The letters that we receive let us know that we are making a difference.If we could get help with the postage, that will keep us going longer.

    we have been sending packages for the last 8 years. We are open every Saturday & in the Summer. We have a Community Service letter that we give to each child for their school. They really enjoy helping us. They always come back with their friends. They are doing a wonderful thing and are very proud to help us.

    We are sending out over 600 boxes for  Christmas, this year. The kids have been working very hard for the last 2 months wrapping presents for our men & women & K-9 dogs. Every one on our list gets a regular box of snacks & toiletries & another box of Christmas presents.  I tell the children, they should be very proud of all the hard work they have done. They are going to put alot of smiles on their faces overseas.
