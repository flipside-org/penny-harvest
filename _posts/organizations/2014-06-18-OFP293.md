  Have you ever thought that hospitals were scary places? Well, we at The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, try to make kids' hospital stays happier. We offer many programs to help children feel more comfortable in the hospital. The Child Life program has experts who help patients understand what will happen during their stay here. The Family Learning Place is a library where patients and families can get information about illnesses. And the Carl Sagan Discovery Program is an interactive science and technology program, helping patients learn about themselves, the world and the universe.
mission: |
  The Children's Hospital at Montefiore has many unique inpatient, outpatient and community-based programs designed to meet all of your child's physical and emotional needs. We draw on the multidisciplinary expertise of CHAMâ€™s pioneering and nationally-renowned physicians and staff to provide state-of-the-art treatment in a warm, caring environment.

    Books for the Family Learning Place - This library usually spends about $20 on each book. A grant of $400 would allow us to buy 20 books to help children and families get important information about their illness. 

    Medical Play Doll - Our Child Life Specialists use special dolls to explain medical procedures to children. These dolls have special parts that allow children to see their body parts, and our staff can explain. 

    Entertainment - Even kids in the hospital want to see movies. Every $100 donation will help us buy 5 new videos or dvds to make their time in the hospital a little more fun! A donation of $250 would help us buy a tv/dvd/game system on a cart that we can use for patients who are so sick that they can not be around other children.

    Birthday Parties - Nobody can control when they get sick - and sometimes, kids have to spend their birthdays in the hospital. When that happens, we like to have birthday parties to make the day special. Each party costs about $50, to pay for a cake, decorations, and a birthday gift. A donation of $750 would pay for 15 parties. 

    There are lots of other ways that you can help The Children's Hospital at Montefiore - we hope you will help us find the right way for your school to support our hospital!

  Hi, my name is Paula and I work in the Development Office at Montefiore Medical Center. My department raises money to pay for equipment and programs at The Children's Hospital and for Montefiore's three other hospitals. I love my job, because I meet a lot of really great people who really care about others and want to help. I hope that I have the chance to work with your school this year!
