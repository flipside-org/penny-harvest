  Hi, my name is Salil Wilson and I've been with the World Harmony Run since 1987. I first participated in the World Harmony Run in Australia, where I'm from, and totally loved it. I was on the team for three weeks and we visited lots of schools sharing the message that harmony begins in the heart of each one of us. I love doing this because I love running and meeting great people.
