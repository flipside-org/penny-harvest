    $5 raised by students for School & Youth Programs helps LLS invest in cures for kids with blood cancers.   $10 helps an LLS-funded researcher to grow cells in a lab for a week, to understand how well a new blood cancer therapy might work.  $70 allows one patient to participate in an LLS telephone/web education program which features medical experts who provide the latest disease and treatment information.  $75 covers the cost of one tissue typing test that is used to become a bone marrow donor.  $150 helps fund general lab supplies for one week to help LLS-funded researchers conduct laboratory work needed to make life-saving blood cancer treatments possible.  $200 supports a research fellow for a day.     $300 provides support for one week for LLS clinical specialists to identify eligible patients for important clinical trials to advance new, lifesaving therapies for blood cancers.   $300 funds one week of important one-on-one and group support for families dealing with the challenges of blood cancer treatment.  $750 funds targeted whole exome sequencing in 1 patient to discover common mutations in genes known to be important in blood cancers.    $900 allows LLS researchers to isolate T cells from a patientâ€™s blood to be used in a promising experimental immunotherapy clinical trial.

    Pennies for PatientsÂ®:  A community service learning program for students, grades K-12, in which they collect funds, starting with their own spare change, to support the research & patient services programs of LLS.   How it Works: Students collect over an approximate three week period during the Fall & Spring months. Change is collected and/or online donations are made from friends, family and school fundraisers in honor of local student blood cancer patients and survivors.     We Make it Easy: LLS provides all the materials a school needs to run the program, including lesson plans, Dear Parent Letters, classroom and individual collection boxes, and educational DVDs. Additionally, many schools choose to implement educational activities provided by LLS, including kickoff assemblies and fundraising planning meetings.
