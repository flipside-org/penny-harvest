  There are many animals who do not have homes and are placed in the city shelter.  Unfortunately, many are put to sleep and the city continues to cut funding and not build more shelters.  We rescue as many as we can from there and place them into our no-kill facility and find them homes.  
mission: |
  The mission of Animal Center of Queens, Inc. (ACQ) is to educate and inform the public about responsible companion and animal ownership. ACQ operates a no kill shelter in Queens County in New York City which provides homeless and displaced companion animals with temporary shelter.

    One of our biggest expenses are our vet bills.  Many wonderful Dogs and Cats are placed into the city shelter because of an illness that the owner cannot or will not pay for.  In order for us to rescue it, we need funds to help us pay some of the costs.  Your generous grant, no matter the amount, would go to help the most deserving and needy pet so it can be seen by a vet.  A healthy animal is an ADOPTABLE animal.

    One of our expenses and needs is to update and upgrade our cages and kennels. This equipment, especially the larger sizes is very expensive.  Your grant would help us buy the best available products currently on the market so our Dogs and Cats can be comfortable until they are adopted.

    Volunteers are almost always needed to help walk dogs and clean the kennels and care for the cats and kittens.  The animals are cared for 7 Days a Week so any days and times you can help would be gladly accepted.  Many other opportunities also exist.

    Raising money to support the shelter is an on-going and difficult effort.  We have to pay rent, electric, heat, phone and other assorted bills every month.  This puts a tremendous burden on our rescue efforts.

    

    Volunteers can help with fundraising drives such as selling t-shirts, garage sells, bowling fundraisers, etc.  If you can help or even just generate a turnout for an existing event would be a great help.
