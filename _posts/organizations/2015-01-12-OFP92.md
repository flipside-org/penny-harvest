  FeelGoodCU is the Columbia University chapter of FeelGood, which has taken root on 24 university campuses.  FeelGood is a youth movement committed to ending world hunger in our lifetime. On college campuses across the U.S., FeelGood students run non-profit delis specializing in grilled cheese sandwiches. 100% of deli proceeds are invested in organizations sustainably eradicating global hunger.  Our chapter in particular gives all deli proceeds to The Hunger Project. FeelGood delis are also a place for creative interaction and education—an inviting environment for customers to learn about hunger’s causes, consequences and solutions. By learning to run a successful social enterprise, we experience firsthand our capacity as changemakers: People with the ability to respond creatively, compassionately and strategically to the world's most pressing needs.

    Our on campus kiosk always needs funding.  We need money for new grilling supplies, specialty food, and for marketing materials.  We need funding for our deli to run smoothly, so we can sell more sandwiches.  Each sale raises both money and awareness in hope of eliminating Hunger.  This grant could range from $50-$700.

    Apart from our 5-night per week deli, we like to spread awareness of global issues through campus events.  For these events we need to cover media costs and costs to bring influential speakers to campus.

  My name is Murrill Oakes and I am a student at Barnard College of Columbia University. I am majoring in Architecture, with a minor in Dance. In fall 2009, I was introduced to the FeelGood organization and chose to join Columbia University’s quest to eradicate World Hunger. I credit my love of the environment and of my human family to growing up in North Carolina where backyard, community gardens abound.
