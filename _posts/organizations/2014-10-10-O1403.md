  Weston United, based in Harlem, changes the lives of

  homeless people for the benefit of themselves and the

  community. Consumers develop a sense of worth through involvement

  in housing, social support, training and employment and mental health services.

  Consumers achieve self-determination by sharing their vision and voice in the rehabilitation process.
