mission: |
  TLC has a unique approach to addressing both the immediate needs (effects) and foundational needs (causes) of ailing communities. Our Cause and Effect approach allows us to address the lack of resources while providing opportunities for development. These opportunities include developing educational programs for children and adults, providing access to resources, and guidance in reaching financial stability.

  We want participants to live life on purpose; creating a legacy for the community and generations to come.
