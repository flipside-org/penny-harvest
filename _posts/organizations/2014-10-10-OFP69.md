  I always thought a bake sale was all about the cupcake icing, until I became involved with Cookies for Kids' Cancer. At Cookies, we make a tough topic so much sweeter by talking about cookies, cupcakes and other treats. Did you know cancer is the #1 disease killer of kids under the age of 18? And did you know that with your help, we can turn that terrible fact into a piece of history - just by raising money to support new treatments. More money means more treatments which gives more kids a chance for a bright future! Thanks - we hope to hear from you soon!
