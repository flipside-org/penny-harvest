  The S.L.E. Lupus Foundation helps people with lupus, a serious illness that affects 1-1/2 million people in the U.S., including about 300,000 children.  Systemic lupus erythematosus (the "S.L.E." in our name) or LUPUS is a serious disease in which the bodyâ€™s immune system -- which is supposed to fight off germs and other harmful things -- goes haywire and attacks healthy organs, including the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, skin, joints and blood.  There is still no cure for lupus, but the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation is working hard to help people with lupus to get the help they need as quickly as possible.  We also have special programs for children and families to help them cope with having such a serious illness.

    Since 2000, the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation has partnered with Camp Sunshine, a summer camp in Maine especially for families with children living with serious illness, to provide children with lupus and their families a week-long vacation in the country.  â€œLupus Week at Camp Sunshineâ€ gives children with lupus a chance to play just like other kids, while their parents, brothers and sisters, grandparents, and/or other family members feel safe because their children are looked after by a doctor and other medical experts at the camp.  And the whole family gets to have fun at Camp Sunshine, with lots of regular camp activities -- sports and other outdoor playtime for those feeling well enough, and indoor games and crafts for children who need more rest -- plus lessons about how they can help each other when their disease "flares" (gets worse).  The S.L.E. Lupus Foundation is asking for your help to pay for camp and/or for bus transportation from New York City to Maine, where Camp Sunshine is located:  $1500 will send one family to Lupus Week at Camp Sunshine $300 will pay for the bus fare from NYC to Maine and back home again   For more information on Lupus Week at Camp Sunshine, please go to this page on our website: http://lupusny.org/programs/kids
