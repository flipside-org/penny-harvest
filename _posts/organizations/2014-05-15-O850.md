  Manhattanville's My Soldier is a student/staff-run program that allows the American public to "adopt" a deployed United States Armed Serviceperson. Regardless of an individual's political views and opinion of warfare, our troops need our support. My Soldier has opened a new portal that puts politics aside to educate, bond, and strengthen the American community.
