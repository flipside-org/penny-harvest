  Project Hawai'i is a nonprofit organization that runs 100% by volunteers. We provide year round services to the children living homeless in poverty situations. Our agency is solely supported by public donations, which means we do not have government or other grants to help the children.

  We provide children with basic life needs, like food, healthy hot meals, clothing, educational supplies, summer camp, holiday parties, etc.

  Aloha, My name is Magin Patrick, the director of Project Hawai'i, Inc. I actually am one of  the founders who created this nonprofit to allow the community to take on responsibilities for the over all success of our programs. While I have not worked with Common Cents before, I have worked with various students across the united states to empower them to make a difference in the world around them. For example one middle school classroom conducted a service learning project, developed a mock business and then raised enough funds to pay for our summer camp transportation needs. Another class was able to fill 150 stockings for homeless children. Even against all odds, two boys who attend one of the most at risks and poverty stricken school were able to collect enough snacks to provide an entire week of snacks to our summer camp.

  I have helped to develop projects that any classroom can take on and make a difference regardless where they are located, or what their financial situations might be.

  So, feel free to contact me with your goals and I will help you make a plan for success
