mission: |
  The Hebrew Free Loan Society makes interest-free loans for philanthropic purposes throughout the New York metropolitan area. Our goal is to provide financial assistance that helps borrowers achieve and maintain economic self- sufficiency. We make loans on a nonsectarian basis where the availability of interest-free credit will make a significant difference in an individual's or family's life.

  Our loans also help ensure the continued vibrancy of New York's Jewish community by strengthening Jewish institutions and helping individuals meet the cost of participating in the community.
