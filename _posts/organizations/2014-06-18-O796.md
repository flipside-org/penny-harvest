  Meals on wheels makes it possible for a person to remain independent and at home. Meals on Wheels can provide short-term assistance for someone recuperating from surgery or an illness or can provide long-term service when needed.

   Eligibility is based entirely upon each person's need. The typical MOW client is 60 years old or older, must be totally homebound, clients must be unable to prepare meals, have no family or friends to assist with meal preparation, have no access to a Senior Center close to home and have no cooking facilities at home.
