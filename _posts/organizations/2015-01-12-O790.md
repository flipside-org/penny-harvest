  Meals on Heels prepares and delivers a hot meal every Saturday to homebound elderly in New York City from 59th Street to 14th Street. Volunteers spend part of the morning in the Church's soup kitchen as prep-chefs; buttering bread, chopping vegetables, or spicing up stew. Then they deliver meals to friendly and thankful elderly residents. Meals on Heels is the perfect activity for people who have little free time during weekdays but still want to give something back to the community.
