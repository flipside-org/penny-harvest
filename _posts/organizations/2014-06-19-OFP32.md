  Did you ever wonder how children go to school if they have no home?  Or how they get to school if their family has no money? Did you ever wonder how a baby learns to talk when no one talks to them?  Well, here at the Association to Benefit Children (ABC) we are dedicated to helping all those children and their families who may seem lost. We help them have a place to go each day that is safe and fun.  We don't want their moms and dads worrying about their children while they try to get a job or go back to school or try to find an apartment.  We make sure the families never feel alone and help them as they work hard to get back on their feet. While in our care, the children can go to our school when they are babies through age 4.  While we care for them, we are teaching their moms and dads and sometimes grandparents how to help their children be healthy and strong, not just physically, but emotionally and mentally as well.  The caretakers are welcome in our classrooms with their children or we go with them to their homes.  You know you don't need a lot of money to help a child grow and learn.  Socks, clothes, cartons of food, and spoons, and pots become balls, musical instruments, tools for sorting, counting, reading, and imagining.  We help parents see what gifts they can give their child by just talking, looking, reading, and listening.  We help the child by helping the entire family.

  

  
mission: |
  The Association to Benefit Children (ABC) was founded to challenge and to change the myriad assaults to childhood. Hunger, poverty, homelessness, physical and emotional abuse, abandonment, HIV infection, and substance abuse endanger children’s welfare and undermine their future. These perils have shaped ABC’s course, spurring the formation of cost-effective, replicable programs that bring about palpable change and help children reach their fullest potential. Through advocacy efforts and direct services engaging the whole family, ABC strives to give vulnerable children the chance to experience tenderness, success, hope and love. ABC has permanently altered the public debate, improving the lives of children who, otherwise, might have waited unnoticed, vulnerable and suffering, with no advocate to witness their pain and give voice to their needs.

  Hello My name is MaryEllen and I have had the pleasure of providing services to the young children who reside in East Harlem for the past eleven years.  The best part of my job is to see the smiling faces of the children each day and for 8, sometimes 10 hours I can keep them safe offer them nutritious meals, and watch them play and grow without the adult stressors which they sometimes take on after they leave our school.
