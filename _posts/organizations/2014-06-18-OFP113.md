  The Haliyma Barrow Foundation’s goal is to reduce the high level of teen pregnancies within the state of New York and by extension the nation. We plan to fulfill our mission by providing educational, mentoring, career planning, counseling, and day care services to pregnant and parenting teens. By offering teens a safe and nurturing place in which to learn, achieve, and mature, our organization will help to prevent additional pregnancies. Also, teen parents will be provided with a foundation on which they can grow into successful adults capable of raising children who will avoid the pitfalls of teen pregnancy, thus breaking the generational cycle of hopelessness, underachievement, and delinquency.
mission: |
  The Haliyma Barrow Foundation is a New York based 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization that promotes the holistic development of teen parents through counseling and mentoring programs, while empowering them to pursue their educational and career goals.

    This program will help teen mothers and their babies make a healthy start as families by providing for their basic needs. We will identify teens in the most need and send them care packages that include baby bottles, diapers, lotion, body wash, powder, bibs, pacifiers, teethers, rattles, body suits, hats, booties, bedroom slippers, and night gowns. 

    One care package costs $50, so a grant of $1000 would buy 20 care packages.
