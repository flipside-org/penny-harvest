  Pietro’sfight.org is a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness and funds to find a cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It was founded by Manni and Dayna Scarso in 2012 after the couple learned the devastating news that their then-3-year-old son Pietro was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) – the most common and lethal childhood genetic disorder in the world affecting one in every 3,500 male births.
