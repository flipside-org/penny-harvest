mission: |
  Pratham, which means "first" in Sanskrit was founded in the slums of Mumbai in 1994 with UNICEF support.  Today, Prathamâ€™s direct urban programs, including pre-schools, community libraries and remedial learning programs reach hundreds of thousands of children every year.  In 2007, with the support of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Pratham launched the Read India campaign, an innovative, low-cost effort to reach the  ~100 million children in India who cannot read, write or do basic math.   With the continued support of the Hewlett Foundation in 2010, the Read India campaign has entered its second phase focusing its attention at the village level and addressing more advanced levels of learning.
