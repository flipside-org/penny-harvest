    Birch Family Camp serves children and families living with HIV/AIDS in New York and is staffed by many New York volunteers.  Each family who comes to the camp attends at no charge since the majority of them live in poverty.  With a donation of $500 you can cover the cost of one family of four's meals for their week at camp!

    We fly our campers at no charge from all over the US and the cost of travel is about $500 per child.  This includes airline tickets, unaccompanied minor fees, and ground transportation to our wilderness camp.  So, with a $1,000 grant you could fund two campers' travel to take part in the best week of their lives!

    Birch Family Camp needs volunteers for different New York opportunities year round.  Anyone, anywhere can set up an HIV/AIDS education event as a service to their community.  We can support that effort and provide materials or possibly bring speakers to the location.

    We sell chocolate lollipops and Camp Heartland pins for small donations.  Students can help us sell these items in order to raise money and awareness to support our programs that help make life better for kids with HIV/AIDS.

  Hi!  My name is Nick and this is my fourth year working for One Heartland.  During the year I work with students like you who support our Camps and during the summer I help at Camp as a counselor in Minnesota.  I love working with our campers affected by HIV/AIDS!  They get to come to Camp and just be normal kids -- they don't have to worry about their HIV status and they can just have FUN.  In New York, we also have the Birch Family Camp that serves hundreds of New Yorkers who live with HIV every day.  I really enjoy telling people about how to be a friend to those with HIV because they're just people like you and me.  What you are doing is a great endeavor!  I can't wait to introduce you to our New York volunteers and have them come and talk about our work and our families in your classrooms!  I look forward to talking with you!
