  The Grace Foundation was created to support and advocate for Staten Island and Brooklyn families of children diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders. This support takes the form of social, educational and information resources. We take a proactive role with families, professionals and government officials in the development and advancement of education policies and programs that deal specifically with autism/pervasive developmental disorder (PDD).
