  ALS advocates for clean water, healthy wildlife habitat, and undeveloped coastlines...for laws to protect beaches.  We sue polluters and restore wetlands; defend the public's right of access to the shoreline.  We run NY's involvement in the annual International Coastal Cleanup, staff the Jamaica Bay Guardian to monitor water quality and educate boaters and anglers, and work to reverse loss of marshes in the bay. We welcome volunteers from cub scouts to seniors.

  The American Littoral Society is not a book club.  We are a coastal conservation organization working to protect the fragile fabric of life along the shore.  I have been director of our chapter for over 20 years and look forward to working with students who care about the environment.  This is the third year we have worked with Common Cents.
