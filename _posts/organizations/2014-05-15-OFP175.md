  In New York City, more than one in four children live in homes that do not always have access to enough safe and nutritious food. More than 1.2 million New Yorkers, including these children, do not have enough money to feed themselves and their families. They face the hard choice between paying for food and rent; food and medicine; food and school books. The New York City Coalition Against Hunger (NYCCAH) works with New York City's over 1,100 soup kitchens and food pantries to make sure New Yorkers have enough to eat.  Since 1983 we have helped hundreds of food pantries and soup kitchens receive more food and money, and have created programs to help move many low-income New Yorkers out of poverty so they can provide for their families.
mission: |
  The New York City Coalition Against Hunger (NYCCAH) represents the more than 1,200 charitable soup kitchens and food pantries in New York City, as well as the over one million low-income New Yorkers forced to rely on these agencies to feed themselves and their families. The Coalition works to meet the immediate food needs of low-income New Yorkers while enacting innovative solutions to help them move “beyond the soup kitchen” towards greater economic self-sufficiency.

  Hello, my name is Ivonne and I would like to help you learn how you can fight hunger in our city.  My job is to make sure that my organization has enough money to help people that don't have enough food for their families. We think it is wonderful how your teachers are getting you involved in giving back to the less fortunate here in New York City.  We appreciate your help and hope we can visit you soon!
