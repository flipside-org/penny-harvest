  The Academy of Urban Planning, housed in the Bushwick High School building, is committed to helping kids who really need it, whether they are pregnant, are already parents, or come from foster homes. "You can have a great school by picking the right kids or you can have kids that you help overcome obstacles," said founding principal Monique Darrisaw, who led the school from its start in 2003 until early 2011, when Rodney Orji was named interim acting principal.
