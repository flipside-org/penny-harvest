mission: |
  Established in 1996, the Aisling Center's main principle is to assist Irish immigrants in their transition to life in the USA. We do this by offering a number of services including legal, social, psychological and educational. The Aisling Center is one of the largest Irish immigrant resource centers in the tri-state area and the main provider of services for the elderly Irish and Irish-American community in Yonkers and Woodlawn. Please visit our services page to see all that we have to offer.

    Through the Irish Volunteers for the Homeless, we feed up to 300 homeless people every week at a cost of just $1 per person. The annual cost of this program exceeds $15,000 annually. This program is also beneficial to the elderly living in the community as they volunteer to prepare the food each week, so it gives them a sense of purpose and makes them feel very useful and wanted. At the same time, we are providing nourishing food for hundreds of hungry and homeless people.
