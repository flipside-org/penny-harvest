  Daniel was an infant, living in a drafty, rodent-infested fifth-floor rental walkup in Brooklyn, when he suddenly started wheezing and gasping for breath. He was rushed to the emergency room, where the doctor diagnosed an asthmatic condition caused by the mold in his rundown apartment. Today, thanks to Habitat-NYC, Daniel, now six, lives with his mother, brothers and sisters in their own home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He has not had an asthma attack since the family moved to this safe haven, and last year he donated his $4 allowance to our organization and insisted on coming to our offices with his mother to deliver it himself.

  At Habitat-NYC, we believe a simple, decent home is a right, not a privilege. Along with 5,000-7,000 volunteers a year, Habitat families like Daniel's build their own homes, and give a bright coat of paint to community rooms, where neighborhood children play and learn, in our Brush with Kindness program.  Together, we revitalize neighborhoods and transform lives.

  My name is Judith Werner. I help raise money used to build homes for ownership in the five boroughs of New York City. I'm so glad that Penny Harvest students are learning that even small donations can make big changes in people's lives. Our donors and volunteers feel the same way, as in this volunteer's story: "My name is Alex Liberatore and I am a Cornerstone Office Volunteer at Habitat for Humanity. I wanted to work in an office where I could help people help themselves and I don’t get paid for my work, but every day when I return to my home, I feel enriched due to the satisfaction of working towards the improvement in the quality of living for my fellow New Yorkers.  I had just started working at Habitat, after working on Wall Street for many years, when the Roundtable Group at the Herman Schreiber School invited Habitat for Humanity – New York City to their party to celebrate their $200.00 grant. We arrived at this Pre-Kindergarten to Fifth Grade school in the early afternoon and were treated to a ceremony including songs, poetry readings and a description of the fun they had raising and counting the money that was donated.  After meeting my new Penny Harvest friends, I had that same feeling of satisfaction, one that is often better than any that money can provide."
