  Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, widely recognized as one of New York’s premier nonprofit organizations, is a 119-

  year-old settlement house that provides an extensive array of effective and integrated human services—social, educational, legal, health, housing, mental health, nutritional and fitness—which significantly improve the lives of 20,000 people in need each year, ages 3 to 103, on the East Side of Manhattan. Operating out of five East Side sites, we serve more than 20,000 people in need each year who live, work or go to school on Manhattan’s East Side and on Roosevelt Island.  The people we help include older adults, homeless and formerly homeless adults, children and families, recent immigrants, disabled persons and thousands more.  We have a 117-year history rich in community activism and innovation, addressing important problems such as the lack of affordable housing and the needs of an aging population.  Founded in 1894 as a free kindergarten for the children of nearby immigrant factory workers, we remain dedicated to improving the quality of life for all individuals and families in need in our community.
