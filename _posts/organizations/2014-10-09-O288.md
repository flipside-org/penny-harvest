mission: |
  nonprofit organization to offer programming in parks throughout the five boroughs of New York City. The Organization was founded in 1989 to support the vast majority of New York City parks without access to private resources. By creating arts, sports and educational programs in over 700 public parks, and by encouraging community development within public parks as a focal point, we help to revitalize not only parks but also the neighborhoods that surround them.
