We have Early Childhood programs, After School programs, Teens,Seniors and Family Center groups.  Our connection with the common Cents program is with P.S.81 and our After School Program working together to make sandwiches for the homeless.

    Our  After School children use the Common Cents grant to help us pay for the cold cuts, bread etc. that we use each week to make sandwiches for the homeless.  These sandwiches are picked up by volunteers who then distribute them at the 242nd Street train station each weekend.  $100-$200

    We are now partnering with the Fieldston school.  We are using their students to help ours with tutoring.  We also allow students from the local schools to fulfill their community service hours here.  We also allow local college students to use our program as the work-study program approved by Manhattan College.
