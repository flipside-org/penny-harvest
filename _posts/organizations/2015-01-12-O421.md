mission: |
  The Flatlands Volunteer Ambulance Corps is a group of people working together to provide our community with the highest quality ambulance service at no charge to the patient or the patient's family. Flatlands responds to approximately 1,000 emergency calls per year. The largest cost factor in our $175,000 budget is over $40,000 in insurance premiums. Financial contributions are important. Without the generous support of the community we could not continue our services. More important is the contribution of time. As people move, get different jobs, or decide to pursue other interests we constantly lose members. Good members are hard to replace. This is especially true of the trained individuals who are responsible for the actual delivery of emergency medical care, our EMTs. We provide all of the training necessary for you to become an EMT.
