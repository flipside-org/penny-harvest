  Established in 1858, the YWCA of the City of New York is one of the nationâ€™s oldest non-profit organizations. Our mission is to address the critical needs of New York City women and to empower them for success and leadership in their lives, jobs and communities. We focus on underserved families through job training, educational child care and after school programs; partnerships with business, government and other not-for-profits; and advocacy on behalf of the clients we serve.
