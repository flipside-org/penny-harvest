  Do you find reading scary, confusing or just boring? Then you've probably never had a chance to read to a dog! Kids who do, in the R.E.A.D. program (Reading Education Assistance Dogs) tell us that "He never laughs at me if I make a mistake," "he never tells me to hurry up!" or "I love the way he listens without interrupting." Learning to read is the most vital first step in your education, and R.E.A.D. dogs make it fun while helping reading skills improve dramatically! Funds that you kids raise for R.E.A.D. will help us find and train more good dogs to be literacy mentors.

  Hi, I am Kathy, director of Intermountain Therapy Animals and author of the Reading Education Assistance Dogs training manual. My dog Foster, an Australian Shepherd, and I worked together doing animal-assisted therapy for 8 years. The R.E.A.D. program is now a national educational partner with PBS Television, and active in 49 states and Canada! It is the most fun way for kids to practice their reading and to discover what a wonderful thing reading can be.
