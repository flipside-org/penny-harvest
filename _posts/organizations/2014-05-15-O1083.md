mission: |
  Row New York is a unique non-profit organization that combines intensive rowing activities with individualized academic support to empower girls in New York City to pursue excellence in all facets of their lives.

  

  Row New York was founded in 2002 on the belief that a sport that improves physical and mental health and teaches the invaluable lessons of teamwork, tenacity, and commitment to self and others should be available to the youth of New York City. We began with a borrowed boat and eight eager participants, and now serve over 300 girls a year with a boathouse full of equipment
