mission: |
  We believe that human relationships are as important as physical environment to solving the challenges faced by the people we serve. By recognizing that each of our clients has unique needs and strengths, and by treating each person with dignity and respect, and expecting the same in return, we are able to successfully empower those we serve to achieve and maintain a healthier and more independent life. We do this by listening, by meeting people where they're at, and by empowering them to be a force of change in their own lives.
