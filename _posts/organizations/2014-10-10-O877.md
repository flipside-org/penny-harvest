mission: |
  Our mission is focused:  to improve the vision of the less fortunate by purchasing new eyeglasses in the United States, and recycling donated glasses for distribution in developing nations worldwide. Since our founding in 1932, New Eyes has improved the eyesight of more than 7.5 million people around the world. For about $50, New Eyes for the Needy can improve a person's life. Each new pair of glasses purchased by New Eyes helps an American child succeed in school, an adult secure a job, or a senior citizen read medicine labels. Our recycled glasses bring clearer vision to scores of people living in poverty overseas. New Eyes is strengthened by our partnerships with thousands of social service agencies, optical dispensers, and vision missions.
