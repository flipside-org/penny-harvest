  The ultimate goal of Bet Elazraki Children's Home is to help each child who is brought there to become an emotionally and physically healthy young adult who is prepared to function and be a productive member of society. The objective is to shatter the vicious cycle of distress so they will be the last in their family to need residential placement.
