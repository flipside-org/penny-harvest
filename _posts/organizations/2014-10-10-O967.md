mission: |
  To save abandoned and abused animals by placing them into rescues and then their forever homes.

  

  To solicit medical assistance and donations to supply any and all care they need, without crippling any Rescues or Owners.

  

  To enlist as many Veterinarians and Animal Emergency Hospitals to work together for affordable care for rescued animals.

  

  To create a fund to offset medical costs for responsible, loving pet owners who are unable to afford it and eliminate needless euthanasia.

  

  To find as many forever homes for our precious, loving pets, as humanly possible.

  

  To reduce the high incidents of unnecessary euthanasia incurred on our defenseless pets forced into overcrowding shelters.
