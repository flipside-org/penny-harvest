description: 
mission: |
  Citymeals-on-Wheels seeks to provide a continuous lifeline of nutritious food and human company to homebound elderly New Yorkers in need, thereby helping them to live with dignity in their own familiar homes and communities.

  Thanks to our partnership with the New York City Department for the Aging, along with gifts designated for administrative expenses, we are able to promise that 100% of all other donations will be used entirely for the preparation and delivery of meals.
