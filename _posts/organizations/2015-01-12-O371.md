mission: |
  Work with inner city youth through a number of community collaborations, to improve their academic performance in mathematics, science and technology, in order to insure higher levels of Access, Achievement and Success in the most prestigious colleges and universities throughout our country.

  

  One of the driving issues influencing the discourse over Education Reform is the much reported concern regarding the apparent academic achievement gap between students who reside in low-income and often minority communities, and their more affluent counterparts, in middle and upper income communities.
