mission: |
  UNWANTED NYC PETS is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and placement of homeless animals many of whom are rescued at the very last moment from euthanasia at city shelters. UNWANTED NYC PETS is not a shelter, but instead relies solely on a network of foster homes. We depend on the generosity of fellow animal lovers to help defray the costs which include veterinary bills, and other medical expenses for animals who come to us sick, or in need of special care, as well as food, supplies and other items needed for the safety and comfort of our rescues.
