  The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island provides a home away from home for families of seriously ill children staying in area hospitals.
mission: |
  

   The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island is a "home away from home" providing comfort and shelter to families experiencing the pain of having a sick child in an area hospital. Families live with us, prepare their meals, and are able to come and go as necessary.

    Share-A-Night Program:

    

    A one night stay at RMH-LI costs approximately $100 per night. However, no family is ever asked to donate more than $25 a night to stay with us. In 2010, the House accommodated 868 families. The lengths of stay of these families are as follows: 438 families - 1 to 3 days; 183 families - 4 to 7 days; 113 families - 8 to 14 days; 75 families - 15 to 30 days; 29 families - 31 to 45 days; 30 families - over 45 days.

    

    In order to bridge this gap, the Share-a-Night Program was developed. Under this unique program, donations from corporations, foundations and individuals are used to support the cost of the day-to-day operations of the House. Share-a-Night continues to be a major initiative and accomplishment of RMH-LI.  

    A commitment to this critical and successful program is a memorable way to help a child by providing them with the very thing they need most during this time; their family. A $1,000 grant to Share-a-Night (the approximate cost for 10 nights) would go a long way to offset costs to all families in need.

    Every $100.00 of grant money would go towards offsetting the cost of a one night's stay at The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island.

    Little Hands Helping Little Hands was developed to provide volunteer opportunities at The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island for children between the ages of 6 & 16. Groups from schools and youth organizations use the kitchen facilities at the House to bake goodies for the families and children staying at the House. This program teaches children the importance of volunteering by empowering them to help others. This will help them become capable and caring leaders of the future.

  Hello Students,

  

  I am in charge of raising money to help families stay close to their children while their children stay in area hospitals.  I also live at the House to make sure that if there is a family emergency that someone is available to help them.  I have been working at The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island for four years and have enjoyed working with Common Cents schools in the past.

  

  Thank you,

  

  Mike Pfeiffer
