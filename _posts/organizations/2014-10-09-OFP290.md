  Life in New York City is tough for many kids.  Every day, many have to deal with crime, drugs, abuse or not having enough money for food or a place to live.

  

  We want to help.  The Catalog for Giving is a lot like the catalogs you see all the time that sell things.  But our catalog shows the kids in local afterschool programs, and how important these programs are to help the kids learn new skills, work hard, and succeed in life.

  

  Your donation will help us to give money to these afterschool programs to make them stronger and help lots of kids, the same age as you and in your city, who have to deal with hard problems every day.

  

  Since 1994, we have raised more than $10 million and helped almost 100,000 kids.  Please help us to make even more of a difference in the lives of New York City kids.

    $250 will pay for one child to join any of our afterschool programs.  The ten programs involve sports, arts, writing, farming and many more fun activities, while teaching important lessons that will help the kids to succeed.

    Card Creation:  Please help us to make greeting cards to welcome kids that are new to our afterschool programs each year.  We would also like to create cards to congratulate kids who graduate from the programs or reach big goals like making the honor roll or getting into college.  This will make the kids very happy, and encourage them to keep doing well.

    Letter Launch:  Please help us by writing letters to all the kids in your school, your families, and people in your community to tell them about the important work that The Catalog is doing, and why you support us.  This will help us to teach many more people about our work, and help to raise more money for the kids in the programs.

  Hello!

  

  Thanks so much for your interest in The Catalog for Giving.  I help the organization with raising money and holding special events each year.  I've been with this charity for almost a year, and we have not worked with any Common Cents schools yet.  We would love to work with you!  Please contact me with any questions you have.
