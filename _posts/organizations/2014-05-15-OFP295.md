  The mission of The DOME Project is to help kids and their families who don't have or need help with very important things like education, health, and medical insurance.   Our programs gives kids positive, fun and educational activities. We believe all kids should have access to computers, a safe environment to study and do homework, and the ability to express themselves through music, poems and art.  We have three programs. Our Alternative to Detention program helps kids who have gotten into  trouble with the law and gives them a second chance to change their lives and be better in their community. We also have a Tutoring Program to help students with homework, and a College Program to help students with college applications, scholarships and college trips

    Each of our educational workshops that teach our kids about learning important skills like managing time and how to deal with anger costs $50 a session, so a $500 grant can cover the cost of 10 educational workshops.

    Each month we reward our participants that have shown a lot of improvement a movie ticket to go see a film for free to recognize their hard work in the Alternative to Detention program. Most of our participants cannot afford to see a movie because they don't have money to spend on most things. Each ticket costs $10.00 so a $300 grant would buy 30 tickets to give to our kids for free.

    The DOME Project is able to do what we do because of people who support us and give us money, books, and other things for our kids. We always make sure to thank them. With the help of students, we can send thank you letters to all of our supporters. We think that hand written letters will make the people who help us feel special.

    We want students to help make our office a fun and beautiful place to work and visit. With art work made by students that we can hang on our walls, we hope to make our office a better place to work and visit. We hope the attention will also bring in people who want to find out more about what we do.

  The easiest way to describe what we do each day is help kids that get into trouble with the police. We help them to see that going to school is the best way to stay out of trouble. We go with them and their families to court and tell the judge about how they are doing at school, at home and in our group. I have been at The DOME for 3 years. I love my job. I think that most kids who get involved in gangs and do bad things deserve a second chance to change their ways and realize that being good is the way to be. We received 4 grants last year from an elementary school in the Bronx and one in Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. The kids in those schools wanted to help The DOME because they felt that gangs and violence were the most serious concerns they had in their communities.
