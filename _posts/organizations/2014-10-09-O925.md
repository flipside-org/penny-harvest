  The Church operates an extensive Food Distribution Program with a Soup Kitchen on its premises. Open Door conducts a tutoring program at the church for elementary, middle, and high school students. Volunteers at the church work with students on a one-on-one basis.

  Open Door's Missionary Department visits those who are sick, homebound, or in hospitals, institutions, and shelters. Also, complementing the wide variety of services provided by the Church, Open Door hosts discussion and fellowship groups: Men's and Women's fellowship groups. These are two separate groups organized to provide an atmosphere for men and women to discuss everyday living problems, such as jobs, family problems, substance abuse, relationships and other issues in a supportive environment.
