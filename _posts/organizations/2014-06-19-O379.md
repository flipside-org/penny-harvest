  Eden II is an internationally known non-profit organization serving families living with autism throughout their lives. Services include school programs for youth, adult day and vocational programs, group homes, extensive family support, and community outreach.

  

  Autism is a devastating developmental disorder that disrupts an individual’s ability to communicate and relate to those around them. The incidence of autism continues to increase at an alarming rate. Today, one child in every 100 born has some form of the disorder. For families of people with autism, Eden II’s programs are a lifeline and a source of hope. Many call it a place of miracles.

  

  The fact is autism is treatable and people with autism do learn.
