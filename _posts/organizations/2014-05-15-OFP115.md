  For 30 Years Happiness Is Camping has provided free sleepaway camp for boys and girls with cancer. We give kids fighting this terrible illness the opportunity to be "regular kids" away at camp and climb a tower, jump in the pool, play sports, all with the best medical care possible. Camp docs and nurses can even do chemo which allows really sick kids the chance to attend.

  My dad helped start the camp over 30 years ago when a kid he knew had cancer and couldn't go to camp. I've been part of the camp since I was a kid and help to run it now. I have two boys, 16 and 17 years old, so I know how tough it would be if they were sick. My eldest son has worked at camp for two years now and will start college in the fall.
