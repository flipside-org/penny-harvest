  MercyFirst is a child welfare agency that provides services to more than 3500 children and their families each year.  We believe that every person has the right to feel safe and to develop to their fullest potential.  We offer foster boarding homes to more than 550 children.  We also have 122 young boys and girls living in cottages on our Long Island campus and 7 group homes for young boys and girls who cannot live with their own families.  Many of these young people have been the victims of child abuse or neglect and some have gotten themselves into trouble.  We work with them and their families to try to put the family back together.  We also help hundreds of families who are having trouble keeping their children at home in a safe environment.  The agency is 118 years old!                                                          
mission: |
  Mercy First is the new name for Angel Guardian Children and Family Services. Our mission for 104 years has been to provide a community of care for children and families in crisis, for their dignity now and the promise of the future. WE are guided in this critical work by the philosophy that the family is the primary unit of society and that all children are entitled to love, safety and a permanent home. Mercy first works to strengthen families and to ensure that no child ever has to be alone, afraid or unloved.

    We take care of 550 children, from infancy to 18 years of age in foster homes throughout Brooklyn and Queens.  A grant of $500 would help us to pay for school supplies, toys, recreation and educational activities for these children.

    We have a Preventive Service office in Brooklyn  that helps keep 60 families each year, who are having problems, together.  We provide services so that the children in these families can stay at home and not have to move to a foster home.  A $400. grant for this program would be used to help these families provide properly for their children.  For example, it could be used to pay heating/electric bills, for emergency food, diapers, or for medicine etc.

contact_person_intro: |
  I am a Social Worker and a Grant Writer and I have worked at MercyFirst for more than 33 years.  I completed an application for a school a few years ago and we were awarded a grant to help a seriously disabled young foster child who needed a special bed.  Our children need so much help and it is great to know that so many children in New York City are willing to help them.
