  Imagine what it would be like not to be able to run around and play and talk to your friends. Some babies are born without the ability to speak or walk. We help disabled children learn to talk, walk, and become more independent. We also provide services for their families.  Contact me to find out more about how your pennies can help us!

  Hello!

  I have been the director of the Children's Center for over twenty-five years. I try to provide the best services for children with disabilities, to give them opportunities to learn and to have fun too! Our school is a very pleasant place, where all the staff are very committed to  helping the children grow and progress in any way they can. We have receved three gifts for our school from Common Cents in the past few years.  Keep up the good work!
