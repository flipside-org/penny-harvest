mission: |
  The Eastern Queens Alliance is an association of civic associations that joined forces in 1989 to address problems, issues and concerns that plagued or all or most of our communities.  We are a proactive organization, striving to be ever vigilant to prevent problems before they become entrenched.  In doing so, we collectively enlist the aid of elected officials, as well as the government and private agencies who are charged with the responsibility and who have the resources to assist us.
