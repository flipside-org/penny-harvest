  The ASPCA has been saving animals for 143 years.  We make sure that people do not abuse animals.  We also make sure that homeless dogs and cats are adopted into caring, forever homes.  The ASPCA saves animals by collecting evidence in cruelty cases; making sure that those who do abuse animals either go to jail or pay a fine; educating people on how to care for their pets properly and with compassion; assisting those who cannot pay for spay/neuter surgeries, adoption, and veterinary services by giving them the services for less than what we normally charge or for free.
mission: |
  The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) exists to promote humane principles, prevent cruelty and alleviate pain, fear and suffering in animals. Founded in 1866, we were the first humane organization established in the Western Hemisphere. We provide national programming and leadership in humane education, public awareness, government affairs and public policy, shelter support, animal medical services, and animal placement. Our New York City headquarters houses a full service animal hospital, behavior therapy center, adoption facility, and Humane Law Enforcement Department.

    With a grant of $200 to $500, our mobile clinics can help animals in poor communities by providing medicines and services for no cost or low cost. The ASPCA can also use the money to feed animals in our shelter and get them ready to be adopted into a loving, forever home.

    A grant of $500 to $1,000 would help the ASPCAâ€™s Humane Law Enforcement save more animals from abuse and provide them with the medical care that saves their lives.

    We are celebrating our 143rd Anniversary this year. On April 7th several buildings throughout New York City are going to be lit with our new color: Orange. It would be great if you can show your love for animals by going Orange and sending us a picture of how you decided to celebrate our 140th Anniversary. Check out http://www.aspca.org/140 to find out how you can print a free poster, put your picture on our web-site and help us celebrate.

  I have been with the ASPCA for four years in various roles, most often with a focus on grassroots fundraising and community outreach.  This past summer I had the honor of visiting many schools to accept Penny Harvest donation and speak to the children responsible for those donations and it was an incredibly gratifying experience.  I think what you do through the CommonCents program is amazing and really helps organizations in your communities do the important work they do. Keep up the great work!
