mission: |
  Beyond raising money, we seem to have built a community- of friends first and foremost, and of people who together want to make a difference and have found that that change begins within themselves. People are pushing themselves to be their best selves as they raise this money outlined above. They are making pigrimages to work in Nepal. They are donating to causes within their local communities by being inspired by this virtual one. They are sharing their work with others. This is most inspiring to the four of us.
