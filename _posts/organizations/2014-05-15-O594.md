  The Hugs and Hope Club for Sick Kids is a ministry devoted to encouraging children battling critical illness and their families.   

  *The HUGS and HOPE Club provides the rare gift of friendship:  a listening ear, a sympathetic heart.*

  

  Our mission is to share God's love and provide friendship and support to families of sick children who live within the United States by sending happy mail and offering various activities to children between the ages of 2 and 17.  

   We do this through the following projects and programs:

  

  * Mailing cheery cards (a.k.a. "happy mail")

  

  * Providing balloon bouquets to hospitalized children

  

  * Granting children's wishes 

  * Providing Christmas gifts through our Elf Project

  

  * Assigning a  personal "parent pal" who encourages, cheers, and supports the family in crisis.
