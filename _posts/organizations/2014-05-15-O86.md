mission: |
  To rescue and welcome abandoned and unwanted companion animals in a No-Kill environment.

   To shelter, nurture, and support all loving animals until they find their families and can leave us for safe, caring homes.

   To give care with compassion.

   To gently and lovingly end the suffering of an animal if it is too ill or injured to recover.

   To provide spay and neuter services to ensure that our animals cannot create other unwanted animals.

   To take our mission out into the community to teach people about humane treatment and kindness toward animals and the importance of spay/neutering.

   To be loving and supportive: with the animals, in our community, and to each other.
