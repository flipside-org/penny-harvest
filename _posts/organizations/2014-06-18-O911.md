mission: |
  NSWC is a community based grass roots organization. Our mission is to advance and promote increased safe and sustainable public access to the waterfront. To build healthier, greener communities along the Kill Van Kull. To advance public policies and laws to be inclusive of the needs of Staten Islandâ€™s North Shore environmental justice communities and waterfront communities. While working with civic associations, neighborhoods and environmental groups, businesses, industries, government agencies and the general public, like you!
