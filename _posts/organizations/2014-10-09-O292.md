mission: |
  C.A.P. (Clearview Assistance Program) is a volunteer-run program, created by Clearview residents, with one aim: to help Clearview Gardens residents, particularly senior citizens. Clearview Gardens is a NORC (Naturally Occuring Retirement Community), but any shareholder with a need can request assistance. Residents reach out to other residents as phone buddies; teen volunteers from local schools assist with shopping; the professional social workers try to help shareholders obtain government services they are entitled to. Also available are in-home nurse visits, buses to local shopping areas and doctorâ€™s offices, and informative ongoing programs which include speakers, exercise classes, and more.
