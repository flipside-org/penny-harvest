mission: |
  As originators of the Housing First model, Pathways to Housing seeks to transform individual lives by ending homelessness and supporting recovery for those with psychiatric disabilities.  We believe housing is a basic human right, and aspire to change the practice of homeless services by:

  

  Providing immediate access to permanent independent apartments, without preconditions

  

  Setting the standard for services driven by consumer choice that support recovery and community integration

  

  Conducting research to find innovative solutions and best practices for those who suffer from mental illness and homelessness
