mission: |
  Our mission is to drive positive change through the power of entertainment. Since we first set up shop in 1985, we’ve been doing three main things…

  We raise millions of pounds through two big fundraising campaigns – Red Nose Day and Sport Relief. We spend that money in the best possible way to tackle the root causes of poverty and social injustice. We use the power of our brand to raise awareness of the issues that we care most about.

  Over the years we’ve inspired a lot of people who don’t normally ‘do’ charity to, well, do charity. The support we’ve had from so many friends has always blown us away – and still does today.
