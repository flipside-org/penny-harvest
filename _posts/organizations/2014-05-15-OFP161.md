  Mollie's Fund was started because Mollie passed away from Melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer, when she was only 20 years old.  We knew that we could make a difference and save lives if we taught children, teenagers and adults about the dangers of the sun and how to prevent melanoma.
mission: |
  Our mission is to increase awareness for melanoma prevention, provide information and services on skin cancer detection, and support melanoma patients through education of the latest treatments.

    Mollie's Fund's mission is to educate people about sun prevention and melanoma.  We do this in many ways.  We give out brochures that we made in English, Spanish, and French.  We also made a brochures for new mothers so they get some information about how to protect their babies from the sun.  The brochures cost us 50 cents each.  We hang up posters in public places so people can read about the dangers of the sun and how to protect themselves.  The posters cost us $10 each.  Your donations can help us fund brochures and posters.

    We provide sunblock at many pools, sporting events and fairs so that people can protect themselves from the sun.  (one gallon of sunblock costs $80.) Your donation can help kids cover up and protect themselves from a sunburn.

  We are the parents of Mollie Biggane.  Mollie died when she was only 20 years old from melanoma.  Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and it is preventable.  You have to know how to protect yourself in the sun and be educated about melanoma.  The mission of Mollie's Fund is to educate as many children, teenagers and adults as possible so that no one has to go through what Mollie went through.  We need as many voices as possible spreading the word about the dangers of the sun!  

  The fall of 2011 was our first year with Common Cents and we are very glad to be working with Common Cents.  Common Cents is important to Mollie's Fund because we want as many students as possible to help us spread the word about Mollie's Fund and melanoma.
