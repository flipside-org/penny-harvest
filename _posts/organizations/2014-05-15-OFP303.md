description: |
  The Guild for Exceptional Children provides education, homes,clinical services, service coordination, recreation and after-school services to infants, children and adults with developmental disabilities. The Guild was founded in 1958, and has grown to serve nearly 1000 people each day. Here at the Guild, we believe that every person has talents and abilities. It is our mission to provide the education and supports so that people with learning challenges can triumph over those challenges and live full and meaningful lives. The people in our care learn new skills and become more independent while they give back to the community.  They help provide meals to senior citizens; help make Brooklyn "Greener" through our Greenhouse Program and recycling efforts; and volunteer at many Brooklyn sites where they help other people in need.  Your contribution helps the people in our care as well as others in the community, and we are very proud of our success.
mission: |
  To help each individual reach his or her maximum potential; and to help families cope with the responsibility of caring for a disabled family member at home. To achieve this goal, a dedicated, well qualified and caring staff provide clinical, therapeutic, educational, social, residential, recreational and support services designed to stimulate the development of the whole person, fostering self-esteem and pride in accomplishment.

    The Guild would benefit from cash grants to help meet the "special needs" of people in our care, because our funding sources do not always meet those needs.  For example, some people need wheelchairs and modifications to their residences to be able to continue to live there.  Some babies we care for need special modified toys to be able to play. Some of the people in our care need special dental work. Some older people we serve need special supplies and extra help. Our funding sources do not always pay for all of these costs and we count on contributions and fund-raising to meet these special needs.

    The Guild has two special programs -- a Greenhouse and a Ceramics Workshop -- that provide enjoyment as well as valuable skills to the people in our care.  These programs require new supplies on a regular basis, such as new flower pots and tools; fertilizer, soil and peat; ceramics molds and clay; paints and glazing compounds.  Assistance in this area would help guarantee that we are able to keep these important programs running.

  My name is Paul Cassone.  I became the C.E.O. of the Guild in April of 2005 but I have been associated with The Guild since 1972, when I was in high school.  I have a brother who is served by the Guild and who lives in a residence here.  I have seen first-hand how important the work of the Guild is to families and to people with special needs.  I am thankful to you for considering the Guild for a donation and am excited about telling you more about the Guild and collaborating with you on projects.
