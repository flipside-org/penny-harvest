mission: |
  We are dedicated to financially supporting children and families of children diagnosed with Cancer and other life threatening diseases as well as extending to the community a support system by providing a caring resource in which temporary and timely assistance is given to children and their families who find themselves in need of clothing, food, and emergency assistance. As needs change, we are there to develop and implement new programs to help today's youth. We are here to listen to and learn what their changing needs are. We will support, offer guidance, and assist all of the young people, for they will soon be our future.
