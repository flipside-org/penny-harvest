  Together our generation can end extreme poverty.

  

  Mission

  Our mission is to provide the operational platform and resource mobilization for the Millennium Villages Project, which empowers communities to lift themselves out of extreme poverty.

  

  Company Overview

  At Millennium Promise, our vision is the eradication of extreme poverty, hunger, and preventable disease within our lifetime.

  

  We believe that extreme poverty can be cut in half by 2015, even in some of the poorest, most remote places in the world. Through the Millennium Villages Project we are showing how, using a holistic, science-based approach to benefit more than 500,000 people across sub-Saharan Africa.

  

  Description

  Our vision becomes action through the Millennium Villages Project (MVP). 

  More than one billion people worldwide struggle to survive on less than $1 a day. By empowering the poorest of the poor, the Millennium Villages are demonstrating that it is possible to break the cycle of extreme poverty, hunger, and preventable disease and achieve the MDGs throughout sub-Saharan Africa.

  

  The MVP offers an innovative holistic approach to sustainable rural development. As a partnership initiative, the Project is driven by core science and policy leadership of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, alongside Millennium Promise's operational leadership.

  

  Headquartered in New York with regional offices in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dakar, Senegal, Millennium Promise operates Millennium Village sites in 10 countries.

  I joined Millennium Promise in October 2012. I work in the Development and Communication Department. Our team raises money and awareness for Millennium Development Goals and our programs in Africa. They aim to tackle poverty from every angle, working with entire communities in Africa so that they can one day be independent and free of poverty. I love working with students passionate about volunteering as I was previously a volunteer coordinator for the US Fund for UNICEF. Please feel free to contact me and I would be happy to discuss with you on how you can get involved!
