  We inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees. We envision a world where trees and forests are abundant, healthy, and sustainable, and highly valued by all people.  We aim to build an organization of dedicated members who lead the way, and help individual citizens plant and care for trees to enrich the environment.
