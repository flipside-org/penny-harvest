  Dear Students,

  Thank you so much for being a part of the Penny Harvest and helping people in need in your community!  My name is Teresa and I am the new Office Manager at The Francesco Loccisano Memorial Foundation, also known as Frankie's Mission.  Our Charity was founded because of the inspiration of the Founder’s son, Frankie, who passed away from cancer.  Frankie’s dream was to help other children with cancer, so we are carrying out his dream by giving toys and money to families of children with cancer.  Thank you for all that you do and we hope that we will be able to work with you in growing Frankie’s Mission to help as many children as possible!

  Thank you very much!

  Sincerely,

  Teresa Gilhooly
