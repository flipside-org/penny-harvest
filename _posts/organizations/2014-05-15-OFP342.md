  If you are a wild animal or bird, New York City is a hard place to live.  If you are injured or ill, who will take care of you?  The Wild Bird Fund treated over 1,300 creatures last year alone.  We mend broken bones, give medicine, feed orphaned babies and get our feathered and furry patients ready to be released back into the wild.

  Karen and Rita run the Wild Bird Fund.  With the help of a lot of volunteers, we care for the many injured, sick or orphaned wild animals and birds that are brought in by caring New Yorkers who find them.  The patient might be a pigeon, a falcon, a sparrow or a bat.  It's challenging, interesting work to diagnose what's wrong with an animal and then try to fix it. It's very sad when you can't cure the animal's problem, but really great when you can make the animal well again.  Then comes the best part -- releasing the animal back to the wild.
