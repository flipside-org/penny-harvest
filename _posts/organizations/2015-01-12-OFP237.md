  We help older people.  Sometimes they do not have enough to eat and we serve a nutritious meal every day at noon.  They don't have to pay if they don't have the money.  We have some older people that have to find a place to live and we help them fill out forms and do what we can to get them a safe place to live where they can be happy. We tell them all the things they can get from the government to make them live better.

  I am the manager of the center.  I have been with this center for 27 years. I love my job because it helps people who really need help with everyday problems. I have worked with common cents for 3 years because it really helps both the students and the seniors develop a real friendship.
