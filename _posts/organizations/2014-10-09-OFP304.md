  The Hance Family Foundation was created to honor the lives of 3 young sisters, Emma, Alyson, and katie Hance, who died in a car accident when they were 8, 7, & 5.  Based on the girls' real life examples, we have children's educational programs that help raise self esteem.  Our girls self esteem program, Beautiful Me...the EAK Project, has already reached over 6,000 girls!  The Hance Family foundation also provides back-to-school supplies and toys and gifts at Christmas time to underprivileged children.  Happy, Healthy, and Safe children are our highest priority!

    The Hance Family Foundation's Beautiful Me... the EAK Project is a self esteem program for girls.  It costs the Foundation approximately $15 per girl to attend the program.  This cost covers materials and the small gift that each girl receives from Mrs. Jackie Hance as a thank you for being a part of the program.  Beautiful Me groups are typically limited to 10 children per group, so $150 would pay for an entire Beautiful Me group.

    Each holiday season, the Hance Family Foundation hosts a toy drive.  We then hand deliver these gifts to needy children in the Bronx, Harlem, Far Rockaway, Floral Park, Elmont, Hempstead, and wherever we find they are needed.  Children could help by hosting a toy drive at their school, or working together to "adopt-a-family" on our wish list.

    The Hance Family Foundation hosts several outdoor events at a local Gardens.  In the weeks before these events, we have big weeding/clean-up days to help prepare the grounds for the upcoming events.  We can always use a little extra elbow grease on these days!

  Hi my name is Bernadette Smith and I am the Executive Director of the Hance Family Foundation.  I have been with this Foundation since the very beginning, and have enjoyed making a truly positive impact on the lives of children.  I love that this Foundation has been able to make something positive out of such a negative event.  We get to spend time meeting new people and helping out so many kids - it's an wonderful organization that is growing by leaps and bounds!  And it is very meaningful to me that we do all this work in the name of three very special girls.
