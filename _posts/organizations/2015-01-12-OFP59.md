  The Child Abuse Prevention Program (CAPP), a independent non-profit agency founded in 1986, is the only agency of its kind. Over the past 27 years, CAPP has reached over 440,000 New York City school children and made them aware of their right to be safe. Our mission is to insure that all of our children enjoy this basic right. CAPP provides vital child safety information to children, families, community groups and law enforcement agencies. The cornerstone of CAPP’s work is an award-winning Child Safety Workshop that uses life-sized puppets to teach school children to recognize, resist and report instances of abuse and neglect.

    Being removed from an abusive environment can be very scary for a child in response, CAPP created the Childrens Clothes Closet at the Safe Horizon Child Advocacy Center's in NYC. Since Hurricane Sandy 50% of funds raised for this program have benefited relief efforts for Hurricane Sandy. 50% benefits victims of abuse who are being moved into foster care. The program provides clothing, tolietries, toys, books and othe necessities for children.

    A $100-500 grant would be used to support the program in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island.

    Child Safety Workshops: The cornerstone of CAPP’s work, this program uses life-size puppets to educate school children about physical and sexual abuse. 

    Evaluations have shown that the puppets create an element of enchantment that is an essential tool in breaking down the barrier that often isolates abused children and keeps them from reaching out. Furthermore, children perceive the puppets as their peers. In hearing the puppets openly discuss incidents of abuse and neglect, they feel safe to discuss their own encounters, fears and curiosities. 

    In addition to helping children recognize overt instances of abuse, the skits also explore subtle forms of manipulation that accompany abusive behavior.  CAPP skits expose and refute these forms of manipulation, and help children understand that they are never to blame for the actions of their abusers.

    

    Intervention: Child abusers have a tremendous mental and physical advantage over children.  It is crucial, therefore, that children are not only given prevention education but also understand that reporting abuse is not only okay but the right thing to do. Statistics prove that when children report abuse immediately, treatment and rehabilitation are typically very successful.

    

    To this end, the workshops are followed by a discussion period where children are encouraged to ask questions and interact with the puppets.  As noted, this form of interaction gives children the courage to come forward and disclose incidents of abuse and neglect that may be occurring in their lives.  Additionally, children are provided with an opportunity to speak privately with CAPP educators and school counselors at this time.

    

    After a disclosure is made to CAPP educators, the information is reviewed with a school based support team that consists primarily of principals and guidance counselors.  Disclosures are evaluated and recommendations are made in terms of next steps.  Working with these support teams, CAPP monitors the progress of each disclosure to its conclusion.  Disclosures made by the children have resulted in parenting classes, counseling, reports to appropriate authorities and in the most severe cases, the removal of children to safer environments while family members receive help.

    

    The cost to bring the program to one child is $20 per child.  A grant of $500 will underwrite the program for about 25 children, while a grant of $1,000 will underwrite the program for about 50 children.

    CAPP has partnered with Safe Horizon Jane Barker Brooklyn Child Advocacy Center in downtown Brooklyn for more than 9 years.  In 2008, with the support of donors, CAPP opened new Children’s Clothes Closets at Safe Horizon’s Staten Island location and the Hudson County Child Advocacy Center in Jersey City, New Jersey.  CAPP recently opened a fourth Closet at the Safe Horizon Child Advocacy Center in Manhattan and completed work on a fifth closet in Queens last fall.

    

    Due to issues of confidentiality, students are not allowed to visit the Clothes Closet.  However, the students can help by volunteering to put together bags of schools supplies for children to use when they return to school.  CAPP will provide the supplies and set aside a few hours for the children to visit our office in downtown Manhattan and put together the bags, or CAPP can come to the school to carry out this project.

  Hi my name is Patrice. I have worked at the Child Abuse Prevention Program for 15 years. We work with schools in New York to educate children about abuse prevention and to help children who are living in abusive situations. We are proud to work with other children who want to help kids who are afraid and alone to get the help they need and deserve.
