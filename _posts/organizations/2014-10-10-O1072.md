mission: |
  Rock CAN Roll, inc., is a volunteer, non profit, hunger relief organization committed to restocking the dwindling shelves of local food pantries, soup kitchens, safe homes and shelters. The concept is simple, the rewards are immense! We coordinate events and create projects by collecting canned food (and other essential necessities) for men, women and children in need of assistance. We work together with schools, social groups, corporations, the arts and the music industry to collect and deliver much needed items to organizations (with no fee, no cost and no expense) to organizations that help people that lack food security and are in need of fundamental support.demonstrate to all, how a small act of giving CAN turn into an immense project of good!
