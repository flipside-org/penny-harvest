mission: |
  Much more than a walk around a track, Relay is a time to celebrate those who have battled cancer, remember those lost, and get inspired to fight back. Those who have shared the same experience find common ground, hope, and healing at Relay. By participating, you have the power to continue the American Cancer Society's progress toward a future where cancer doesn't take the lives of our friends and family.
