  There are many children in New York City who are sometimes so sick, that their parents can not take care of them at home.  Many of these children grow up in the hospital where they don’t get to experience some of the things that are normal for kids, like going to the park to play a game or going to the movies.  Some kids have spent so much time in the hospital that they don’t even remember the feel of sunshine on their face.  New Alternatives for Children, Inc. (NAC) was founded on the belief that all children, including those who are very ill or physically challenged, have the right to live in safe, loving, and permanent homes with a family to call their own.  We help families care for their children at home and away from the hospital so that they can do things like go to summer camp, meet with friends, receive mentoring and tutoring help and eventually even go on to college and get jobs.  NAC helps our kids succeed so they can reach their dreams, whatever they may be.
mission: |
  New Alternatives for Children (NAC) is a not-for-profit health and social services agency whose exclusive mission is to serve children with disabilities and their families. We provide comprehensive health and social services to support family preservation, reunification, or adoption. NAC facilitates the timely discharge of children with disabilities from hospitals, where they may have lived well beyond medical need. Within the community, our goal is to provide and coordinate comprehensive services for our clients' physical, social, educational, recreational and healthcare needs. Comprehensive health and social services are offered through two major program divisions at NAC: the Preventive Services Program and the Foster Care and Adoption Program.

    throughout the year, NAC welcomes individuals to hold Gift Drives to benefit NAC's children and families.  Examples include our Camp Supply Drive, School Supply Drive, Book Drive, and Holiday Gift Drive.  Many of NAC's children would not receive gifts during the holidays if it weren't for the generous donations of outside groups and individuals. In addition our supply drives are critical for ensuring that our children receive the basic tools they need for success in live.

  My name is Gajtana Simonovski and I am the Volunteer Director at New Alternatives For Children.  I have worked at NAC since October, 2011.   NAC has been lucky enough to receive three grants from Common Cents.  The monies we received have helped us improve the lives of disabled children by sending them to camp, funding activities such as holiday parties, and paying for adoption parties.  Your generous donations truly help make a difference.  We look forward to future opportunities to collaborate on behalf of the children with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses that are served by NAC.  We appreciate your continued support.
