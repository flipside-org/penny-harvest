mission: |
  PATH Family Center is a clinical center in Staten Island that offers integrative and nutritional interventions for individuals diagnosed with Autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Food Allergies and other related conditions. Our doctor, nurse, nutritionist & special educator comprise a team whose goal it is to restore total body balance in the individual.

  

  We discover the underlying problems through a series of lab tests. The team then creates a custom nutritional protocol with diet plans and integrative guides that begin the process of recovery, as well as offering educational guidance. We also offer Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy which is used for a variety of illnesses, including Lyme Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Traumatic Brain Injuries, Cerebral Palsy, Autism and many more.
