description: 
mission: |
  Founded in 1991, City Lights Youth Theatre's mission is to provide young people from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to participate in theatre experiences in order to develop confidence, responsibility, teamwork, and a greater sense of self and community. Our performing arts classes, full-scale productions, and in-school residencies engage children and teens, ages 3-19, in the collaborative process of creating and performing theatre. City Lights seeks to enable students to develop the focus, confidence, and communication skills that can have a dramatic impact on every aspect of their lives. Our teaching staff of professional actors, directors, musicians, choreographers, and playwrights creates a nurturing and supportive environment that encourages risk-taking and promotes the discovery of individual strength.
