  Hey, don't you wish you had more fun projects to do in class? At DonorsChoose.org, we help teachers make their classes more exciting. Teachers make requests for classroom projects and the materials they need for those projects-- from beakers to books, music to maps, computers to crayons to cleats. Donors then go to our website ( www.donorschoose.org ) and choose which project to bring to life. Since we were founded by a teacher in the Bronx in 2000, DonorsChoose.org has provided over $75 million of educational resources to classrooms across the country. Your pennies can help us provide more fun items to more classrooms - maybe even yours!

  Hi everyone, my name is Yaritza and I have been working at DonorsChoose.org for three years. We're excited to work with the Penny Harvest again since we received 3 grants in 2009! My husband is a teacher in the Bronx and he collects pennies with his students every year for the Penny Harvest. He always takes my jar full of pennies to school with him but I don't mind, since I know you all are making good use of them.  Well, we're happy to be working with you all and I know that you'll pick some great classroom projects at DonorsChoose.org, to help out schools like yours.
