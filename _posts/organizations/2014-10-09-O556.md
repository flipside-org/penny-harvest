mission: |
  The purpose of this foundation is to save, rehabilitate and rehome neglected horses that are scheduled to be sent to the slaughterhouse.  The rehabilitation piece is the one that we concentrate most on. We believe that a horse that has suffered abuse during his lifetime must be sound in mind, body and soul before he is adopted out to a new family. We are a "natural rescue" which means we use natural approaches to training, feeding, stabling, hoof care, etc. This healthy, natural care keeps the horses away from chemicals and brings them closer to nature.  To ensure that each horse gets the best care and rehabilitation, we must limit the number of horses that come into the rescue.  We work hands on with each horse and pay 90% of the bills out of pocket.  We do whatever it takes to help the horses.  Luckily, the horses that leave us are happy, confident and ready to face the world.
