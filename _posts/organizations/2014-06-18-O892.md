mission: |
  The New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) is New York State's largest student-directed consumer, environmental and government reform organization. We are a nonpartisan, not-for-profit group established to effect policy reforms while training students and other New Yorkers to be advocates. NYPIRG's 20 college campus chapters <oncampus/offices.html> provide much of NYPIRG's energy, resources, and activism. Each campus chapter consists of full-time staff organizers and a large core of student volunteers. Students at NYPIRG chapters work on projects that both support NYPIRG's statewide agenda and focus on local issues.

  NYPIRG's full-time staff works with students, produces studies on a wide array of topics, coordinates state campaigns and lobbies public officials.
