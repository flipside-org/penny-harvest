mission: |
  Our goals remain steadfast: to ameliorate the plight of abandoned, sick, injured, or neglected animals in New York City; to promote and require spay and neuter as a means of controlling the tragic pet population problem, and to offer refuge, whenever possible, to the neediest animals, where ever they may be.
