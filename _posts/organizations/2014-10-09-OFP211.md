    Through the Peter Pan Birthday Club, a birthday child decides to make a children's hospital the beneficiary of their party. Invitations ask their guests to bring a donation for the hospital instead of a present. PPCF honors this spirit of generosity by sending an additional $100 to child's chosen hospital.  $200 enables us to honor two PPCF birthday clubbers with 2 hospitals as recipients; $300 honors 3 PPCF birthday clubbers with 3 hospitals as receiptents and so on...

    A "Peter Pan Giving Day" is the easiest fundraiser of all.  It can be an organized event, like a school play/concert or a "giving day" during which kids donate allowance movie money, or pocket change.  Here too, a additional donation of $100 will be sent to the hospital chosen by the students as their beneficiary.  If you choose to host a "Peter Pan Giving Day" and raise $100 or more, we can honor your philanthropy with a gift of $100 to the children's hospital of your choice.  Be sure to register your event at www.peterpanchildrensfund.org.

    Through "Cans for Peter Pan," individuals, families, and schools can redeem cans and other materials to be recycled.  The deposit on these items can be collected and donated to a local or national hospital. The longer the collection drive lasts the larger the donation will be!

    "The Lost Boys Book Sale" or "Tinker Bell's Trash or Treasure Swap" are just two of the many service-learning projects suggested in our Philanthropy Education Guide.  Service learning opportunities can easily be adapted to the age/grade level of the students involved.

  Hi! In my new role as Education Director of the PPCF, I am really excited about involving students in philanthropy through the magic of the Peter Pan story.  For more than 100 years, Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Captain Hook and all the other wonderful characters created by Sir James Barrie have delighted children and the young at heart, yet the philanthropic legacy of the story is relatively unknown.  Help us spread the word out so that more people know that Peter Pan was a philanthropist and you can be one too!
