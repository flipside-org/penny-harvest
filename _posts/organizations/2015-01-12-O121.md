mission: |
  The Bay Ridge Center celebrated 26 years of service in October 2002: over a quarter century of commitment to excellence in providing community-based services. It's mission remained unchanged: to improve the quality of life for the area's senior population, assist the needy and stabilize those most at risk in their homes and neighborhood. Over the last year, the Bay Ridge Center provided an array of services to an unduplicated count of 12,972 individuals. (Of this population, 10,701 were senior citizens and 2,271 were under the age 60).
