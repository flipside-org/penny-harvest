  We send very large care packages to soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen who are serving in war zones. These packages contain notes and letters from people across the US as well as snack food, toiletries, socks, and other needed items. These packages encourage our troops by letting them know people at home appreciate their hard work and courage.
mission: |
  Since December 2002, we've supported HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of deployed U.S. troops with loving care packages and letters from all over the nation. This was made possible only with the help of tens of thousands of generous and patriotic friends in the U.S. and abroad. This is the least we can do to show our troops how much we care about them. Our troops need to know that we support and appreciate the sacrifices they make for us, our families, and our future. This is about giving back to those who give all

    Writing notes for the troops - notes and letters are the most important item we send in our care packages. Long after the snacks are eaten and the toiletries used up, our troops still read the letters they receive. They especially enjoy letters from children.

    Decorating posters and Zip-Lock bags for the troops. Along with individual letters troops enjoy posters decorated and signed by children. Gallon and quart size freezer bags, decorated with Sharpie pens, are another item we send to the troops. Troops enjoy these bags to keep food and other items clean from sand, etc...bags decorated and written with words of encouragement also brighten their day.

  When my son was in the army he was a chaplain's assistant, they made a special request for his unit; that is when I learned about Give2TheTroops. Now almost eight years later I'm working to send care packages the sons and daughters who are still serving and working in dangerous places around the world. Our founder and president, Andi Grant Edwards, told me about your organization and suggested I contact you, our branch has received funds from penny drives from schools in the states of Oregon, Washington, and California.
