mission: |
  To provide children of all backgrounds with the skills and abilities that will develop in them the qualities of self-esteem and self-confidence, which are needed to become responsible citizens and leaders."

  

  Variety Boys & Girls Club of Queens is the largest after-school program in Western Queens. With more than 1,000 members paying $25 (or less if the family cannot afford it) we care for nearly 200 children during our after school program.

  

  At the Variety Boys and Grils Club of Queens, youngsters enjoy a safe, active and positive environment as a constructive alternative to the streets.
