  Forty years ago, Larry Ambrosino started the Rocco Laurie Memorial Scholarship Game in memory of Officer Laurie. In Rocco’s name, Larry has managed to help deserving junior high-schoolers accomplish even more by giving them a chance to succeed in life through education. Proceeds from the basketball game tickets all go to the scholarship fund. Along with these proceeds, we also accept and appreciate donations from you, good people who, just like Rocco, wish to see the next generation succeed.

  The introduction of the Purple Shield, based on the Purple Heart of highest U.S. Military honor saw that heroes like Rocco Laurie received due respect and reputation. In addition to the new medal came a new motto “Fidelis Ad Mortem” or “Faithful Until Death”. For cops like Rocco Laurie, who have died in the line of duty, there could not be a more true statement.
