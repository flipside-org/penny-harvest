mission: |
  Human Rights Watch is dedicated to protecting the human rights of people around the world.

  We stand with victims and activists to prevent discrimination, to uphold political freedom, to protect people from inhumane conduct in wartime, and to bring offenders to justice.

  We investigate and expose human rights violations and hold abusers accountable.

  We challenge governments and those who hold power to end abusive practices and respect international human rights law.

  We enlist the public and the international community to support the cause of human rights for all.

  Human Rights Watch is an independent, nongovernmental organization, supported by contributions from private individuals and foundations worldwide. It accepts no government funds, directly or indirectly
