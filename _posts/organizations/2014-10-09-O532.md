  The Mission of the Harvest of Hope Foundation is to provide emergency financial assistance and help coordinate critical social services that are not readily available to migrant farm workers and seasonal agricultural workers at the Federal, State and County levels. We also supply educational financial assistance & scholarships to hardworking migrant students who have excelled in scholastic achievements as well as issue grants to migrant service oriented agencies. We strive to educate today's society through social awareness about the life struggles and difficult plight of migrant agricultural and seasonal farm workers.
