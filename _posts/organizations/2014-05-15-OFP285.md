  Sunrise Day Camp is the only dedicated day camp in the nation for children with cancer and their healthy siblings.  Sunrise is a very special place where children can come free of charge, and enjoy a summer filled with fun, friendship and activities – things often denied them because of their medical condition.  

  This past summer, we welcomed over 400 campers into Sunrise Day Camp.  These campers came from as far north as the Bronx and as far east as Shirley, NY.  They came out to camp as many days as their bodies could get them there.  And even when they were too tired to play sports – they came to camp just to be with their new friends – friends who understood exactly what they were experiencing.  You see Sunrise Day Camp offers much more than a summer experience.  With your help, Sunrise Day Camp offers friendships built on love and understanding of a unique, shared experience.    

  In addition to our summer camp, Sunrise offers a variety of year round programming.  There are mini-camp reunions one Sunday per month and fun activities during school vacations.  We also bring camp into area hospitals daily through Sunrise On Wheels!   Sunrise On Wheels transforms the outpatient waiting rooms of four area hospitals.  Sunrise staff together with trained volunteers roll a rainbow trunk filled with toys, games and crafts into the pediatric outpatient clinics to engage children in “camp-like” activities, helping to transform their long days in the clinic into wonderful a “camp” experience.  
mission: |
  Sunrise Day Camp, for children ages 3-16, is the only day camp on the East Coast for children with cancer. It is a camp designed to meet the emotional, social, recreational and physical needs of these children while allowing them to enjoy the comforts and safety of their own homes at night. Best of all, Sunrise Day Camp is offered free of charge to all children being treated for cancer on a non-sectarian basis. By raising the needed funds from outside sources instead of charging the parents, we can help to alleviate some of the costs, and the related stress, that parents incur caring for a sick child throughout the year.

  My name is Amy Pilott and I began working with Sunrise Day Camp in March 2009.  In my first week of work, I visited a Penny Harvest school in Brooklyn and listened as a colleague presented to the class.... something I have now done MANY times myself.  I can not describe to you in simple words how incredible Sunrise is, but I would be happy to show you. I am blessed to have spent two summers at camp with these inspiring children, and though you may not have been there with me, I can show you a video of exactly what camp is like.  I know that a camp for children with cancer sounds really, really sad but it isn't... I promise!  Invite me to come to your school and I will prove to you that with Sunrise Day Camp, children with cancer can have programs filled with fun, laughter and friendship!
