  The Long Island Coalition for the Homeless works with non-profits and local government to create permanent, affordable housing for homeless and at risk Long Islanders.  The Coalition offers direct assistance to homeless and disabled Long Islanders in finding housing and support services. We also provide scholarships to homeless (or formerly homeless) youth going on to college, provide back packs and school supplies for homeless children, as well as a summer camp experience for children in shelters.  The Long Island Coalition for the Homeless collects and distributed essential items to people in need, including coats, clothing, personal care items, household goods, baby items, food, and holiday toys.  The Coalition also raises awareness about homelessness in our region, to help combat the stigma associated with homelessness and poverty.  The Long Island Coalition for the Homeless recently opened the Amityville Community Resource Center, which will house up to ten organizations working with the homeless and with veterans.  The Center will act as a "one stop shop", where veterans can go to receive a variety of services ranging from housing and financial assistance, to employment assistance, help with getting benefits and connecting with other veterans.

    Each year, we distribute up to 4,000 new back packs filled with school supplies to children in need.  In addition, we take up to 450 children from shelters to the Back Pack Pirates Summer Festival, a pirate-themed summer camp experience, filled with recreational and educational activities.  Each child receives breakfast and lunch,new bathing suit and towel,  clothing for school and new back packs with school supplies.  We also provide shoes/sneakers, and other items based upon need and availability.  $30 pays for a new, filled back pack.  $100 pays for a child to attend the Back Pack Pirates Summer Festival and all of the items included above.

    We collect back packs and school supplies, bathing suits,towels and clothing, as described above, from April to August each year.  We host "sort and pack" events to put everything together.  During the school year, we host drives for non-perishable foods, personal care items, winter coats and clothing.  Folks in the community are provided with information, fliers and assistance in conducting drives.

    The Long Island Coalition for the Homeless holds an annual "Have a Heart for the Homeless" Candlelight Vigil each year.  The event takes place in April, with groups in the community holding various drives to help us collect new clothes, food, personal care items, cleaning supplies, baby items and essential household items which are then distributed at the event.  We are always looking for volunteers to help hold drives to collect these items, and to distribute the items during the Vigil.
