  I have founded this volunteer program in 1992. We began by traveling around the Brooklyn & New York area feeding & clothing the Homeless with our out-reach van. When then opened our food pantry the year after to help the needy . Our staff inculding myself are all volunteers.  We started, I believe, the first super market style food pantry in brooklyn 10 years ago. Instead of just handing a bag of food item, our recipents are able to shop for food items that's best for their need and health.  We help to offer a better quality of life to those who are less fortunate.   We are soon opening another location to help more families in need.
