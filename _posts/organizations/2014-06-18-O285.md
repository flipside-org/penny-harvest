description: 
mission: |
  Founded in 1972, the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) is a Bronx-based settlement house. Our mission is to improve the economic and social well-being of individuals, families and communities who are most in need. Our intent is to enable individuals to uncover their potential and improve their lives. To do this we provide direct, hands-on help, community outreach, education, and advocacy, often in collaboration with other organizations. In all aspects of our work, CAB strives for the highest ethical and performance standards and is guided by the belief that people are to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their present situation or past experiences. CAB currently makes a difference in the lives of thousands each year, including individuals at all stages of the life cycle and special needs populations.
