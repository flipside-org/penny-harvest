mission: |
  There are many children around the world whose lives could be vastly improved if they had access to mobility devices such as crutches. Founded in 2009, Crutches 4 Kids (C4K) is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing crutches to impoverished disabled children around the world. Headquartered in New York City, Crutches 4 Kids works in partnership with a network of concerned citizens and humanitarian organizations to send crutches to thousands of children in need, giving the gift not only of mobility, but of dignity, independence, and hope. By giving the worldâ€™s most disadvantaged children the opportunity to walk, Crutches 4 Kids also helps families and caretakers, educates children in the developed world about the value of social service and the power of giving, and aids the environment by recycling surplus crutches.
