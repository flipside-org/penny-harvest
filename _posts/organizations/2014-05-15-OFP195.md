Together with Connecting To Advantages we also help them to become more independent by helping them with Food Stamps, paying bills, and any other problems they may have.    We are open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  We serve the food bags between 1:30 and 3:00 p.m.

    In the near future we would like to become a customer choice pantry so that food pantry guests can choose what they need.   We would need at least a $1,000 grant for this.  That is why it is important to have a person in charge of the food program.  It keeps the food program safe because then there is always someone there to make sure that the hungry people are given the food they need.  The person in charge would need to be paid.

    During Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter we provide special items for our food pantry guests such as turkeys and hams.  It  would be really great if we could have students to help us prepare the food bags that we give along with the turkeys and hams.    We had a wonderful group of young men donate 100 goodie bags with inspirational notes in them.  This meant so much to our food pantry guests because it made them feel good and let them know that things will get better.

  Hi, my name is Nivia Mendez and I have been working at Our Lady of Sorrows Food Pantry for almost four years.  Basically I run the food program that is located on the church grounds.  I order the food, supervise the volunteers that come to help out, prepare the food bags and distribute them and I keep the food pantry organized by keeping a record of the number of people we help to feed each month.  I am also responsible for raising any funds for the food pantry.  My volunteers and I work very hard to help the people in our community.  We love it because it is very fulfilling and worthwhile work.  We are glad that we can do it because we know that it means so much to our food pantry guests.  One of my volunteers put it best, "I can sleep easier at night knowing that I've helped to feed hungry people."
