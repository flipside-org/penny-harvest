  Do you know anyone who has ever been teased or bullied at school? If you have, Smile Train needs support from kids like you to help kids around the world born with cleft lip and palate! Left out of games and fun because they look different, kids who are born with this birth defect can't go to school, play, smile (a lot of things we take for granted) and are excluded and shunned by their community. Since we use local doctors in 84 countries around the world, these kids can get free treatment 365 days out of the year. Surgery costs as little as $250 and takes as little as 45 minutes. We can’t wait for you to get on board with Smile Train to help these kids!
mission: |
  No one knows how many millions of children there are in the world suffering from clefts.

  The greatest tragedy is that all of these children are suffering not because they were born with a cleft, but because they were born poor. Too poor to pay for a simple cure that has been around for decades.

  Helping these children is the mission of The Smile Train. We help provide free cleft surgery and related treatment for children who would otherwise never receive it.

  In as little as 45 minutes, and for as little as $250, we can help give these children not just a new smile — but a second chance at life. With every cleft we repair, we restore a life. With every doctor we train, we help a community take one more step toward self-sufficiency. With every smile we deliver, we bring hope and dignity.

    Students can fundraise for kids with cleft lip and palate through penny drives, bakes sales, yard sales, "jump-a-thons" and other types of fundraisers. To support students with this, we have a complete fundraising kit with our DVD, brochures and poster that we can mail out upon request. Please call or email me so I can assist you and give suggestions!
