  The Tyler Nicole Foundation will provide comfort, care, and support to families that experience the loss of a child or have a child with a life threatening illness.  This will include miscarriages, deaths caused by infants born prematurely, stillborn births, abortions, childhood illnesses, etc.  We will provide services including financial aid, bedside assistance, funeral arrangements, counseling, etc. in an attempt to help ease the burden on the parents and their families, financial and otherwise.  Our goal is to help ease the grieving process in any way so that the families can better cope with their loss, and get on with their lives.  We will also help parents that have high risk pregnancies, and children with life threatening illnesses get them the help they need as to help them get through so that they can have a healthy child.  The organization will help educate and bring about public awareness to the enormity of the widespread problems caused by infant loss, premature births, problems during pregnancy, and childhood illnesses. We will like to make the public aware of the importance of research, the critical need for prenatal care, the need for referrals to high risk pregnancy doctors, education, etc. to help lower the mortality rate.  This will be done through the staging of social events, classes, workshops, exhibitions, recreational entertainment, etc., designed to socialize and familiarize the American people with the plight of infant loss.

    The goal of the Luis Danvers Leukemia Fund is to promote, educate, and spread awareness about leukemia, Luis's fight against leukemia, information about the struggles of patients and their families, and becoming a bone marrow donor.  Leukemia is a cancer  of the bone marrow and blood.  It is characterized by large numbers of abnormal white blood cells that are produced in the bone marrow.  This year, approximately 3,000 children will be diagnosed with leukemia.  Leukemia has an 80% cure rate so most children will be cured in time.  But there are those that will have to receive a bone marrow transplant in order to survive.  There is an unprecedented need to find Bone Marrow donors for those suffering with Leukemia and other blood related illnesses. Each year approximately 10,000 patients (adults and children) need a bone marrow transplant.  The problem is that only 4 out of 10 actually find a match.  To help shed light on the enormity of the situation the Luis Danvers Leukemia Fund started a campaign called "GIVE THANKS, GIVE HOPE".   This organization is trying to raise awareness across the country by speaking to the public at large about leukemia.  We will make the public aware about how leukemia affects the patient and their families.  We will also be putting together successful Bone Marrow Donor Drives. Our goal is to make the public aware about the enormity of the situation caused by leukemia.  We will help people have a better understanding about the disease and the treatment process that the patients face.  We will also let the public know about what they can do to help families in crisis.  Finally, we will increase the number of potential donors on the registry.  Especially when it comes to minorities that make up a combined 20% of the registry.  African Americans make up about 7% of the registry, Hispanics make up about 8%, mixed race makes up about 3%, which lowers their chances of finding a match.  The need for minorities to register and get swabbed is crucial. A person needing a Bone Marrow transplant needs to receive marrow from someone who's tissue type is close to his/her own. Tissue types are inherited, similar to hair an eye color, it is more likely that the recipient will find a suitable donor in a brother or sister. This however happens only 25 to 30 percent of the time, if a family member doesn't match the recipient then you must look outside the family.  So that is why our campaign "GIVE THANKS, GIVE HOPE" is so important. It will effect the lives of so many in need with the help and support of all of you.  Simply swabbing your cheek can save a LIFE.

     We are looking for volunteers to help us work at the bone marrow donor drives swabbing potential donors.

  My name is Sharon Turnage and I am the President and CEO of the Tyler Nicole Foundation Incorporated.
