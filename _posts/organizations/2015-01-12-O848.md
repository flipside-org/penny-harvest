mission: |
  It is difficult to imagine the life of a severely injured soldier recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan, many have had their lives blown up in every sense of the word. Musicorps is an intensive music rehabilitation program that helps injured combat veterans recover their lives.

  

  

  Musicorps replicates “real world” music relationships so that injured veterans work on, and are motivated to work on, robust goal-oriented projects many hours a day. Musicorps integrates individualized projects, regular visits by highly accomplished musicians, and the use of specially-assembled computer-based music workstations along with traditional instruments. Working in any musical style they prefer, veterans are able to learn, play, write, record, and produce original material.
