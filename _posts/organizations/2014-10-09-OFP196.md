  Outlet is a program that creates a safe place for young people between the ages of 11-24, who get bullied for being gay or acting gay. We also educate teachers and other adults who work with all kinds of young people to understand how to help kids be kind to each other. CHAC has many counselors who also help young children and their families get along.
mission: |
  Outlet supports and empowers lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning youth ages 13-20 living on the Peninsula and South Bay. Through our range of support services, leadership training, community education and advocacy, Outlet successfully increases youth confidence, builds personal assets, and creates healthier communities.

    Outlet throws dances for young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people so they can have fun in a safe environment where other kids won't make fun of them. Cash grants help us pay for a space to have the dance and all the staff that needs to be there, buy snacks and drinks, decorations, prizes and DJ's.  The total cost for a dance is about $1000.

    Outlet always has food and drinks at our group meetings for the youth. Our pizza and drinks for a whole year for all the groups costs $1100.

  Hi! My  name is Eileen and I am the director of the Outlet program. I have been working with young children and teenagers for over 14 years. I love working with young people because they are fun and open minded! I help make sure all the services we do actually happen. So I help the other people who work at Outlet do the best job that they can. We haven't worked with Common Cents in the past, but we just received a grant from a school in the Bronx and we are VERY thankful!! It helped us buy a video camera so we can have some of our kids talk on YouTube to other kids who might be too scared to talk to anyone. We are really excited to maybe work with some youth from Common Cents!
