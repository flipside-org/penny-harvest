Organization's overview
Our goal is to connect communities through a shared  
awareness of, and accountability for, the natural  
environment. We foster creativity in sustainability  
through innovative resource exchanges, leadership  
training, and participatory decision-making.  
 
We build knowledge through experiential education,  
share knowledge through collaborative partnerships,  
redefine knowledge through participatory research, and  
communicate knowledge through creative expression.
