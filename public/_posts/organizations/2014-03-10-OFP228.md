Organization's overview
Publicolor works with children from New York City schools to  
change their boring, dreary school building into a fun, energetic  
learning environment.  Through an after-school program called  
Paint Club, students are taught how to paint and then work daily to  
add bright colors to the walls of their schools.  As students  
continue to participate, they have the chance to take part in other  
Publicolor programs, which offer tutoring, career classes, college  
guidance, and even paid painting jobs!
