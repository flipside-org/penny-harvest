Organization's overview
St. Jude Children's Hospital treats children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases.  If a child comes to St. Jude and has no health insurance they are still admitted and treated, free of charge. We do not turn them away. ALSAC is the fundraising arm of the hospital.  We coordinate fundraisers such as the Math-A- Thon & Trike-A-Thon and other special events to raise the money needed to keep the hospital open.
