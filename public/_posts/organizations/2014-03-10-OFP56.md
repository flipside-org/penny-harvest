Organization's overview
Homeless people often are unable to travel and pay for the health care they need.  Care for the Homeless makes health care and medical treatment available at places where homeless people gather. We send medical teams to shelters, soup kitchens, food pantries, and drop-in centers to give homeless children, men and women free health care.
