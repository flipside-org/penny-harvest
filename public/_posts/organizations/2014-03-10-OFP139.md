Organization's overview
Kids With A Cause is a children's charity that encourages and

empowers kids to make a difference. Our organization  
creates "hands-on" programs for kids to help kids and impact each other's lives.  We bring hope, happiness and opportunities to less fortunate children through a unique exchange  program between schools and facilities for disadvantaged youth. Each organization we assist experiences the importance and joy of giving and receiving through philanthropic efforts. We are helping to create a world of "young humanitarians in action."  
 
Kids With A Cause, founded in 1999, facilitates volunteer programs and encourages youth to donate their time to give back to their communities and to the children of the world. 
 
We have conducted over 350 programs since our inception providing a helping hand to children in need both nationally and internationally.
