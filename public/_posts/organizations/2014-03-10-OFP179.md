Organization's overview
We are a Christian based organization in Long Island City for 25 years now serving the food needs of our community each week.  Each Friday we serve around 130 people food who perhaps without help of a food pantry would not have enough to eat. 
 
Our funding comes from state and federal grants as administrated through United Way.  We also are a member of the Food Bank of NY and from time to time are given their grants offered to members. 
 
As a local food pantry for many years who has and is making a difference, the New York School of Urban Ministry  would like to request that we be considered for a $1,000.00 grant from Penny Harvest.  Each bag of food our clients receive cost around $15.00 X 130 bags per week.
