mission: |
  The Pajama Program, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization, provides new, warm pajamas and books to needy children in the United States, and around the world, many who are waiting and hoping to be adopted. These are youngsters who may not know the comforts of a mother or father to tuck them into a cozy bed and read them a bedtime story. Too many have been abandoned, most deprived of any love at all.  Our mission is to provide a loving environment for children who have lived through a great deal of hurt in their young lives to give them hope for a better tomorrow. The program identifies key institutions in major cities in the U.S. and other countries where children are living temporarily as they wait and hope for adoption.

  Hello everyone! My name is Terri Jasen and I have been with Pajama Program for 7 years now and have been working with Common Cents schools for 5 years. I love how the kids are so generous with their time and hearts to help their friends in need. We serve so many needy children and our work never ends, but with the help from kids like you, it brings a smile to our faces and makes us work even harder to collect more pjs and books. Thank you  so much everyone for everything you do!!!
