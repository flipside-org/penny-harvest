Organization's overview
Protectors of Pine Oak Woods was established nearly four decades ago during a battle to preserve Clay Pit Pond State Park.  Since its creation Protectors has helped secure the creation of Blue Heron Park, Kingfisher Park, Mariners Marsh Park, substantial sections of the Greenbelt and others.  Currently, we are seeking support to established Goodhue Woods Park, Fairview Park and the protection of Pouch Camp.
