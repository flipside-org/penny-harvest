Organization's overview
EdPowerment helps young people whose families have  
no money to get a basic education that will allow them to  
go on to college, vocational school, or qualify for a job.   
In Tanzania, students who fail to pass the Standard 7 test  
(at the end of what would be 8th grade in the U.S.) can  
no longer attend public school.  Many of these students  
do not pass because they are orphaned, poor and can  
not attend school regularly.  EdPowerment assists these  
young people in two ways.  We support a small rural  
school where they can continue to study subjects at a  
high school level.  We also provide scholarships that  
allow the more motivated students to go to boarding  
school.  In addition, we support the local community  
through a water well project, health seminars and  
individual family assistance.  Our community school and  
center, Kilimahewa, is a place where children who have  
been left out of the system can go to build a future.
