Organization's overview
Have you ever thought that hospitals were scary places? Well, we at The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, try to make kids' hospital stays happier. We offer many programs to help children feel more comfortable in the hospital. The Child Life program has experts who help patients understand what will happen during their stay here. The Family Learning Place is a library where patients and families can get information about illnesses. And the Carl Sagan Discovery Program is an interactive science and technology program, helping patients learn about themselves, the world and the universe.
