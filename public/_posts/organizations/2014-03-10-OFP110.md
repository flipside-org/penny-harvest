Organization's overview
H2O for Life partners schools in the United States with schools in developing nations in need of water, sanitation, and hygiene education.  Through service learning projects, U.S. students learn of the global water crisis while raising funds to bring water and latrines to their partner schools.  Students learn that they can make a difference in the lives of others by becoming energized global citizens and activists for change.
