Organization's overview
Some babies are born with something wrong with their faces and we think that all these children should have the chance to get their deformities fixed! The Little Baby Face Foundation provides free corrective plastic surgery for children born with facial deformities. We bring children from all over the world and the U.S. to NYC for evaluation and treatment. Contact me to find out how your pennies can help these kids!
