Organization's overview
Plan International USA is an international development  
organization, meaning that we partner with communities  
in developing countries to help them escape extreme  
poverty. Here in the U.S., we work with students and  
teachers to raise awareness of global issues, like poverty  
and children's rights, and we turn local service into global  
impact through our youth-led campaigns.
