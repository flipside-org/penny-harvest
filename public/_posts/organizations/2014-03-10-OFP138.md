Organization's overview
One penny may not seem like much.  But when you take  
time to search out a few cents, you can make a lot of  
positive change in this world.  The students in Kenya are  
just like you.  They dream of being doctors,  
veterinarians, pilots and scientists.  They also know that  
they need to finish school in order to reach these  
dreams.  And that is something you can help them with  
by harvesting pennies that can pay for their school fees!
