Organization's overview
For over 50 years, LSA Family Health Service has been 

quietly helping transform the lives of poor New York  
families in East Harlem by doing whatever is necessary:  
counseling abused mothers, offering food to the hungry,  
providing one-on-one tutoring to children of immigrants,  
or ensuring a family has proper health care.  Established  
in East Harlem in 1958, LSA continues to be an integral  
part of the community and is the organization that  
thousands of families turn to for help.  LSA is a non- 
denominational community-based organization and is not  
supported by the Archdiocese.  LSA offers a range of  
health care and social services, education, advocacy and  
crisis counseling.  No family or individual is ever turned  
away because of an inability to pay.  LSAâ€™s model,  
interdisciplinary approach combines the professional  
services of nurses, social workers, educators, child  
development specialists and lay advocates.
