Organization's overview
The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children helps find kids who have been separated from their families. We also work to keep children safer while they use the Internet. The National Center has a hotline (1-800-THE-LOST) that operates 24 hours a day, and specially trained people on staff help police officers and families find missing children. We also have a website, www.netsmartz.org, that teaches children and teenagers how to be safer online. John Walsh from America's Most Wanted founded the organization with his wife in 1984. Since opening our doors we have helped find over 107,00 children.
