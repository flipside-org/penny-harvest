Organization's overview
The Fresh Air Fund sends children from New York City’s  
neediest communities on free summer vacations to  
summer camp and to stay with host families who live in  
the country.  We’ve been serving New York City kids  
since 1877 and have helped over 1 million kids get a  
break during summer!  Children can go stay with a host  
family for 2 weeks and do things like swimming, biking,  
and just enjoying the outdoors in a new place with new  
friends.  Our host families live in 13 states, from Maine to  
Virginia, and Southern Canada.  Children could also go to  
summer camp – we have five camps all in one location in  
Fishkill, NY.  Our programs are a lot of fun and give inner  
city kids a chance to do something really special during  
the summer!  For more information, please visit our
