Organization's overview
Neighborhood Cats helps kittens and cats who are born  
outdoors and do not have indoor homes of their own.  
Because they're not used to people, these cats (called  
"ferals" or "community cats") can't be adopted in animal  
shelters. Neighborhood Cats helps them by using a  
method called Trap-Neuter-Return, or "TNR" to get them  
spayed and neutered, so even more kittens aren't born  
on the streets. Then we work with other people in the  
community to provide them with good food, warm shelter  
and medical care when they need it. TNR STOPS  
suffering and SAVES lives!
