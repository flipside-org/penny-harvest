Organization's overview
Our mission is to provide high-quality service dogs free-of-charge to disabled American veterans.  Service dogs can and do dramatically improve the quality of life for our servicemen and women who have sacrificed so much for our country.  These dogs help these veterans become more independent and enable them to lead happier, healthier lives.
