Organization's overview
Aisling Irish Community Center delivers a full range of social, educational, cultural and recreational programs for the benefit of the local community. Our programs focus primarily on the more vulnerable members of the community, i.e. the elderly, homeless, unemployed, etc. We have a comprehensive program of events in place for seniors as well as offering outreach services. We also prepare food at the center every Monday night and feed up to 300 homeless people in the city.
