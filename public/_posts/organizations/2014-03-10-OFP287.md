Organization's overview
Since 2000 the American Children's Society has provided financial assistance and other various forms of support to children and families throughout the United States. Our staff is available 24/7 to offer immediate response to the needs of children and their families.  
Our Mission: 
We are dedicated to financially supporting children and families of children diagnosed with Cancer and other life threatening diseases as well as extending to the community a support system by providing a caring resource in which temporary and timely assistance is given to children and their families who find themselves in need of clothing, food, and emergency assistance. As needs change, we are there to develop and implement new programs to help today's youth. We are here to listen to and learn what their changing needs are. We will support, offer guidance, and assist all of the young people, for they will soon be our future.
