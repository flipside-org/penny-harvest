Organization's overview
Did you know that millions of kids just like you have to give themselves multiple shots every day just to stay alive?  They have to do this because they have a disease called type 1 diabetes (T1D).  When a child is diagnosed with diabetes it means that an important part of their body called the pancreas has stopped working the way it should.  Until we can cure diabetes, they will have have to spend the rest of their lives giving themselves countless shots and carefully watching everything they eat each and every day in order to stay alive.   
 
At JDRF, we do everything we can to help these children and their families.  When children are first diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, we send them a "Bag of Hope", a backpack filled with information about their disease, tools that will help them stay healthy, and a teddy bear to comfort them as they struggle with their disease.   From that day forward, we work closely with those children and their families and friends to focus on beating this devastating disease.  Together, we raise money to fund the research that will one day lead us to a cure for diabetes.
