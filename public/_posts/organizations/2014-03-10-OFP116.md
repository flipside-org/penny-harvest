Organization's overview
Harlem has a long list of kids who desperately need help! The little things most folks take for granted, such as safe playgrounds or after school activities, most kids in Harlem donâ€™t have access to. We at Harlem Children's Zone work to make life better for children and families in Harlem through a number of programs and services (community centers, after school programs, social services, health and recreational activities). We have 18 centers that serve more than 20,000 children and adults. With your pennies and your helping hands, you can help us rebuild the community.
