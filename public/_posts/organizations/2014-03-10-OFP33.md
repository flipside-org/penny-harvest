Organization's overview
Autism Ambassadors was founded by 14-year old Zak Kukoff, a student from the tri-state area.  Autism Ambassadors uses a series of lessons, created by Zak and his team, to create real, lasting, friendships between kids with Autism and typical kids.  While these friendships are being built, the kids with Autism learn social, emotional, and academic skills from the typical kids, who are trained in the Autism Ambassadors lessons.
