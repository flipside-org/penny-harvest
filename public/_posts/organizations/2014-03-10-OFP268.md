Organization's overview
Have you ever been hungry and unable to prepare some food to eat?  SNAP delivers hot lunches to homebound elderly who cannot prepare meals for themselves.  An older person who is crippled with arthritis cannot stand in front of the stove to cook a meal and would not safely be able to remain alone in the house.  SNAP delivers a delicious hot meal from a caring person, Monday - Friday and the senior is nourished, happy and safe in the home!
