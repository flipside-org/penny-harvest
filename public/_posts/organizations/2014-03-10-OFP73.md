Organization's overview
The Cypress Hills Child Care Corporation (CHCCC) was founded in 1990 by concerned community women in response to a pressing need for quality child care and stable employment opportunities for women interested in capitalizing on their child rearing skills, and operating their own business. We have since established a Family Day Care Network with 50 Family Day Care providers caring for approximately 425 children, a Head Start Family Day Care program serving 70 children and their families, and an ACD funded day care center caring for 70 children ages three to five. The Cypress Hills Child Care Corporation has an open door policy and services community members need of child care. These services are important in our community because by having child care the community residents can work and earn a living to support their families.  
 
In response to Cypress Hills/East New York's most pressing health needs: obesity, asthma and other ailments, the CHCCC established an annual health fair (every year) that allows us to bring together health care professionals, and community service providers to provide health screenings and information; in addition to a  variety of children activities to Cypress Hills/East New York residents.
