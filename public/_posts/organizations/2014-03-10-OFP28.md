Organization's overview
How many of you have a cat or a dog at home? Dogs and cats are just like us! They need food, water, shelter, doctors, and people to love them. What do you think happens to a cat or a dog that is unwanted or doesn't have a home? Could you survive without a home? Many homeless animals in New York City end up at an animal shelter that will take care of them. That's what we do! We take care of dogs and cats without homes and help them find families who will love them forever. Every penny donated to us provides food, water, and medical care for dozens of animals every day.  At Animal Haven, YOUR pennies save lives.
