  OAR exists to help kids with autism and their families, who deal with a lot of challenges every day.  We do this by sharing information about about autism with parents, teachers, and classmates at school.  Our goal is to help everyone understand that a kid with autism is a person first, and that he or she can be really successful with the right support.  We only share information that is based on good research, so everyone can be part of making the future brighter for kids with autism!

    Kit for Kids peer education program ($15 per kit):  We know that kids with autism and other special needs are bullied three times more often than their peers at school.  This program helps students learn about their classmates with autism, in an effort to build more accepting and understanding school communities. Each kit includes 20 "What's up with Nick?" booklet, a poster, and a student-

    led lesson plan.  A $150.00 grant would deliver the Kit to 10 classrooms and help at least 200 students learn about autism.

    Scholarship program (up to $1,000.00):  More and more kids with autism go to college or vocational school after high school.  OAR offers one-year scholarships of $3,000.00 each.  A grant of $1,000.00 would support one-third of a college scholarship for someone with autism.

    Kit for Kids peer education program:  Recent research has shown that students with autism are three times more likely to be bullied at school, mainly because they seem "different" than everyone else.  The Kit for Kids provides tools (easy-to-read picture booklets, colorful classroom poster, student-led lesson plan) to help raise awareness and understanding of autism among students in elementary and middle school.  Students who want to help can request permission from their teachers to give an age-appropriate presentation about autism, using materials from the Kit for Kids.

  My name is Ben and my job is to teach people about autism through books, videos, and the internet.  I make sure that students, parents, and teachers know where to get the best information possible about how to support their family members and friends with autism.  I love working at OAR because we use the power of education to help people with autism every day!
