Organization's overview
Ruff House Rescue finds needy animals permanent  
homes.   
We rescue from kill shelters in New York and other  
states,  
we rescue strays, and we rescue animals whose owners  
can  
no longer care for them.  We make sure each animal  
goes  
to the vet, gets vaccinated, gets spayed/neutered, gets  
microchipped, and gets a loving fur-ever home.
