Organization's overview
OAR exists to help kids with autism and their families,  
who deal with a lot of challenges every day.  We do this  
by sharing information about about autism with parents,  
teachers, and classmates at school.  Our goal is to help  
everyone understand that a kid with autism is a person  
first, and that he or she can be really successful with the  
right support.  We only share information that is based  
on good research, so everyone can be part of making  
the future brighter for kids with autism!
