Organization's overview
The mission of The DOME Project is to help kids and their families who don't have or need help with very important things like education, health, and medical insurance.   Our programs gives kids positive, fun and educational activities. We believe all kids should have access to computers, a safe environment to study and do homework, and the ability to express themselves through music, poems and art.  We have three programs. Our Alternative to Detention program helps kids who have gotten into  trouble with the law and gives them a second chance to change their lives and be better in their community. We also have a Tutoring Program to help students with homework, and a College Program to help students with college applications, scholarships and college trips
