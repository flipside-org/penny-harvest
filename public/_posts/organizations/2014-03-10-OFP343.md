Organization's overview
After Hurricane Sandy, a group of new and old friend bonded together to aid the community. We are more than just a non-profit organization, we are neighbors helping neighbors. We are in the stage of helping rebuild Staten Island. Staten Strong would love to see their neighbors back home and have their community come back STRONGER than before. Let's help our neighbors together!
