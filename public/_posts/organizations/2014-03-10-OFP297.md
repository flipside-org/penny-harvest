Organization's overview
We rescue cats from the euthanasia lists of local shelters. Then we bring them to a Vet to get their shots and tested for any diseases and spay and neuter them so there will be less unwanted cats.  We foster them until we think they are ready to be adopted.  When ready we put them on our website and in our adoption center and match them with the right family so they will have a forever home.
