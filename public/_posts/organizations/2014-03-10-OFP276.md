Organization's overview
Children learn to cook with Spoons Across America.  Our programs teach hands-on cooking to children. Spoons Across America encourages healthy eating to children, teachers and families. Children tour greenmarkets, cook in the classroom and get to eat the healthy meals that they have cooked. All of the Spoons Across America recipes use a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which are beneficial to long-term health and well-being, and are delicious tasting.
