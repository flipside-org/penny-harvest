Organization's overview
EIS helps New Yorkers stay put!  Every day EIS helps at least one New Yorker-maybe even one of your neighbors or classmates or a person like your grandma-stay in their homes.  Many times families fall behind in their rent-no one wants this to happen, no one plans this-but sometimes a parent or guardian gets sick or loses their job and it's hard to pay the bills.  EIS helps families pay their bills and stay in their homes.  If things get really bad we even have lawyers who will help the family get out of trouble with their landlord.  EIS does every thing we can do to make sure a family stays in their apartment and does not have to live in a homeless shelter.
