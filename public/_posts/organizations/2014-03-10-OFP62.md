Organization's overview
For over 60 years, the Children's Cancer & Blood  
Foundation (CCBF) has been helping children with cancer  
and blood disorders at New York-Presbyterian  
Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. We help to give  
children medicine at the hospital, even when they don't  
have enough money to pay for the medicine. We also  
help doctors find new medicine to make the children feel  
even better so they can have a very long life. Your  
support will help even more children get the medicine  
and care that they need.
