Organization's overview
The Haliyma Barrow Foundationâ€™s goal is to reduce the high level of teen pregnancies within the state of New York and by extension the nation. We plan to fulfill our mission by providing educational, mentoring, career planning, counseling, and day care services to pregnant and parenting teens. By offering teens a safe and nurturing place in which to learn, achieve, and mature, our organization will help to prevent additional pregnancies. Also, teen parents will be provided with a foundation on which they can grow into successful adults capable of raising children who will avoid the pitfalls of teen pregnancy, thus breaking the generational cycle of hopelessness, underachievement, and delinquency.
