Organization's overview
The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park believes in giving children a chance to have fun through learning, exploring, and improving our local environment. Whether the activity is planting a tree, finding some insects, pulling weeds, seeing a tomato grow, finding animals in the lake, or digging through the dirt, we hope to show the great experience that Van Cortlandt Park offers.
