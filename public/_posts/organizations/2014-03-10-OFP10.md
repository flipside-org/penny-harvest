Organization's overview
Alternative House -- The Abused and Homeless 

Children's Refuge provides support for at-risk children,  
youth and families through counseling, shelter and crisis  
intervention.  Our programs include: the Emergency  
Shelter for Teenagers, which is a short-term shelter for  
teens in crisis; AYM (Assisting Young Mothers), which is a  
residential facility for homeless pregnant and parenting  
teens and their children; and Community Outreach,  
which offers after-school programs and street-based  
support to help kids stay in school and away from gangs  
and drugs.
