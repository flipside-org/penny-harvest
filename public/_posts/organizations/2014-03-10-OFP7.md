Organization's overview
Alexandra "Alex" Scott was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer the day before her very first birthday. Alex was a brave and strong little girl who knew no limits. At the young age of 4, Alex announced a seemingly simple idea- she wanted to hold a lemonade stand. When asked by her Mom why she wanted to hold a lemonade stand, Alex simply told her that she " wanted to raise money to help her doctors help other kids like her". At Alex's first lemonade stand, she raised over $2,000 which she quickly gave to "her doctors". Alex continued to hold her annual lemonade stands until she sadly lost her battle to cancer, in 2004 at the age of 8. Before Alex died, she raised a remarkable $1million dollars for childhood cancer research. Now, the foundation that bears her name has since raised over $40 million and has funded more than 150 research projects to help reach Alex's dream- finding a cure for all kids with cancer.
