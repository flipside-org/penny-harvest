Organization's overview
We are a soup kitchen and food pantry that serves the needy of the community.  Our food pantry helps families with additional food to supplement their meals.  Our soup kitchen feeds a large number of mostly men who are homeless, unemployed or low income earners with a hot meal three days per week.  Additionally, we supply clothing as well as social service information that will assist in finding jobs, immigration help, substance abuse treatment, etc.
