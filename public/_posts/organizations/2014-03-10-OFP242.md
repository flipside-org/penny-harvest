Organization's overview
Do you find reading scary, confusing or just boring? Then  
you've probably never had a chance to read to a dog!  
Kids who do, in the R.E.A.D. program (Reading Education  
Assistance Dogs) tell us that "He never laughs at me if I  
make a mistake," "he never tells me to hurry up!" or "I  
love the way he listens without interrupting." Learning to  
read is the most vital first step in your education, and  
R.E.A.D. dogs make it fun while helping reading skills  
improve dramatically! Funds that you kids raise for  
R.E.A.D. will help us find and train more good dogs to be  
literacy mentors.
