  Hurricane Sandy Relief Projects: Your cash grant of $250-

  $2500 will go directly to the Hurricane Sandy relief programs that Rock 'n Renew is working on with the Bayonne School District as well as with schools in our Coney Island and Staten Island programs. This program will focus on the few remaining students and families that have direct-

  needs such as repairs to their homes damaged by the storm. Most of our students have already received aid for the immediate clean-up. Now we are focusing on repairing the ecosystem and habitat, along the shoreline that protects the community from these storms in the future. By doing large-scale native wetland restoration plantings through our Newark Bay restoration program (check it out here: http://tinyurl.com/b45uqrx) Students from over 45 schools in NYC and N.Y will take part in weekly field trips to visit, work, and learn at our three ecology center locations (Ave C btwn 3rd and 4th st in NYC, Grand St. in Brooklyn,and 12. W. 22nd St. in Bayonne, N.j)

  Ecological Restoration of rivers and streams in New York City-

  Students can work with Rock 'n Renew to do an ecological restoration and clean-up of local waterways. We are beginning a HUGE public art project that will include the installation of GIANT sculptures in NEwark Bay, The Hudson River and The East River. These sculptures will actually have pieces that are filled with materials and liquids that have microorganisms (tiny living creatures) that will help to clean the watershed as part of a big project to restore the health of our rivers and streams while better preparing the banks of these rivers to protect us from the storms of the future. With a cash grant students can also come and help install the plants at a variety of locations which we can customize for your school. We have had a lot of success in planning field trips with common cents participants.

  Aloha! Hello! My name is Jonny Dubowsky and I am the Founder and Director of The Rock 'n Renew Foundation. I also am the lead singer and guitarist in the rock band Jonny Lives! I have been an environmentalist since I was in 5th grade, and have been a musician all my life. I started Rock 'n Renew to show students how to use art, music, and science together to help heal our planet. I hope to work with you and have fun making a difference in our world.The small things that we do together will add up to create an incredible amount of positive change in your community.

Rock 'n Renew is a non-profit focused on delivering the most effective environmental education possible to students of all ages through partnerships with today’s most popular musicians. After Hurricane Sandy devastated our region, many of Rock 'n Renew's students lost their homes, especially in our Bayonne and Staten Island and Coney Island schools. As a result of this tragedy, Rock 'n Renew has dedicated a special program for 2013 to help with vital food resources for those families effected by Hurricane Sandy. In addition, we are going to use the Penny Harvest Grants for the repair of the wetlands and shoreline habitat and native plant ecosystems, as these are natures line of defense against storms.  Rock 'n Renew utilizes the power of endorsement and interaction with today’s most important musical artists.  A process that delivers mind opening relevance to this critical subject for students who are often physically and culturally removed from the need to protect and restore the environment.  Rock 'n Renew raises money to support both its scholastic programs and three ecology action sites.  The ecology action sites exemplify Rock 'n Renew's core mission, while serving as destination learning centers and replicable models for the local action projects that students are encouraged to pursue.

Sustainability is when all the parts of something help to make that thing stay healthy. Recognizing the connection between the health of culture and the health of the planet, we use art, music and science to help students heal their local food and ecosystems. Our work focuses to make environmentalism  hip, edgy, artistic, and intelligent. We custom-design eco-blueprints for schools, businesses, and communities that address sustainability from the local perspective, while connecting each community to the larger concerns of the planet. We would love to work with you to make an awesome garden project for your school and community!Jonny (our resident Rock Star; he's been on Conan O'Brien and opened up for everyone from Green Day to Snoop Dogg) will come in and play music for you as well!We will help you to grow healthy food for you and your community. We also run several urban farms with students working as real-life farmers! We donate a large portion of the food we grow to the hungry and homeless, and also help people of all ages learn how to eat better food to stay healthy. We'll also bring performers to play some great Rock 'n Roll music.
