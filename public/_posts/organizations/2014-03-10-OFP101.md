Organization's overview
Not everyone can walk to Central Park or can go see a  
river around here.  We are a visionary community based  
organization in the Mott Haven and Port Morris  
neighborhoods of the South, South Bronx.  We manage an  
exciting community garden that hosts numerous schools  
and groups and serves as an inspiration for many. We  
work to create public access to our waterfront where there  
are many power plants and garbage handling facilities.  We  
work to heal Nature Deficit Disorder and make sure that No  
Child is Left Inside!  We are working to stop Fresh Direct  
from p0olluting and taking over our waterfront without an  
environmental impact statement, see  
boycottfreshdirect.com for more!
