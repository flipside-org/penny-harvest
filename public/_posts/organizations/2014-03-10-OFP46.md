Organization's overview
How would you feel if you were abandoned, homeless, and living on the streets with no food or water? That is the situation that thousands of animals face in our city. To make matters worse, they have no voice to ask for help. This is where Bobbi and the Strays comes in. We take the animals off the streets and find them loving homes.
