Organization's overview
The Bowery Mission has been helping homeless men and women for 127 years.  People are homeless for a variety of reasons, but it means they donâ€™t have a home where they can sleep and eat.  At The Bowery Mission, we make sure homeless men and women have a safe place to sleep, warm meals to eat, clean clothes to wear.  People can get a shower or they can see a doctor.  We have three shelters where people can stay.  Two shelters are for men and one is for women.  Almost 200 people at a time stay at our shelters.  Most people who come to our shelters stay for a while until they can find a place of their own to stay.  In New York, there are lots of people who are hungry for a good meal.  Last year, we served 900 meals every single day at just one of our shelters!  Most of the time, people come inside to eat, but sometimes we go outside and serve meals on the sidewalk.
