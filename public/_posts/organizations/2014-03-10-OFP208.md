Organization's overview
PEP for Seniors is an organization that helps keep seniors in the Bronx healthy and active in the community. We have Social Workers and a Nurse on our staff, and their goal is to keep the seniors as independent as possible so they won't have to go to a nursing home. We provide fun classes that keep seniors active and young at heart, like art, salsa, hip hop dance, yoga, and even belly dancing!
