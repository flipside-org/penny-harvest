Organization's overview
Many kids in New York City don't get enough food to eat  
and can't pay attention or learn in school because their  
stomachs hurt.  But the Food Bank For New York City  
helps hungry kids of all ages, their families and friends  
get free food by providing food to over 1,000 community  
and emergency feeding programs throuought the five  
boroughs. With your help collecting pennies we can help  
feed the over 1.5 million New Yorkers who are hungry.  
With every dollar you donate, we can provide five  
healthy meals to our neighbors. Before we can nourish  
our minds, we must first nourish our bodies and the Food  
Bank For New York City is here working to end hunger in  
our city.
