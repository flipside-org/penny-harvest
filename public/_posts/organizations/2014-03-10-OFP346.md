Organization's overview
World Neighbors is  ending  hunger, poverty and disease in the poorest, most hidden rural villages in Asia, Africa and Latin America. World Neighbors does not give away food or stuff,  we help families and villages fix their own problems by teaching them all of the things necessary to grow their own food, build their own homes, send their children to school, keep themselves healthy and get their own clean water.
