Organization's overview
Our mission is bringing the joy of music, the magic of wishes, the power of information, and compassion to seriously ill children and their families.  We provide Kids' Cancer Pages national resource guides to children, families, and medical professionals all over the country.  We also provide direct services to seriously ill children and families in Oregon and Southwest Washington -- the Chemo Pal program provides adult mentors for children undergoing treatment, the DreamCatcher program grants wishes and provides family support, the Music Rx program provides music therapy, and we offer weekend retreats to families free of charge at our Caring Cabin on the Oregon coast.
