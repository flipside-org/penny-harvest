Organization's overview
Inwood House is dedicated to helping young people take charge of their lives and become healthy and self-reliant adults.  Established in 1830, Inwood House is a nationally recognized leader and innovator in teen pregnancy prevention, youth development and family support.  Today, Inwood House programs support the growth and development of approximately 5,500 underserved youth each year. Our Maternity Residence is a haven for homeless, pregnant teens in foster care. Family Support services help young parents establish strong family units and successfully transition from foster care to independent life through educational and career support, mentoring, counseling, independent living skills courses, parenting workshops, comprehensive sexuality education and expressive therapy. Our award-winning School and Community-based programs provide safe spaces for adolescents to connect to caring adults, discover their potential, and learn to make healthy, responsible decisions.
