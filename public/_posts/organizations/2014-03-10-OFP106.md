Organization's overview
Global Kids helps young people in NYC and Washington, D.C. grow as leaders in their communities and on the international stage. Global Kids leaders learn about international issues and how to become global citizens. The world needs more young people who are ready to create solutions to complex world problems, such as climate change, hunger and violence. Global Kids leaders use theater, digital media, peer education, travel and activism to create a better future for us all.
