Organization's overview
Because of poverty and the HIV/AIDS pandemic (which is when a lot people have the same very bad disease), one in every five children in South Africa is lonely and hungry and doesn't have a parent or other adult in their lives to help them.  Thanks to computers and webcams, adults anywhere in the world, like your mommies and daddies, can see and talk to them every week.  This way, South African children get to have a special aunt, uncle or teacher like the one who cares about you and helps you every week.
