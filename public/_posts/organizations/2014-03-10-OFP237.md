Organization's overview
We are a senior center.  It's like a club for older people.  For Grandma's and Grandpa's.  We provide food and they socialize and have fun exercising and doing Yoga and Zumba! We try to keep them healthy and happy so that their families can enjoy them for a long time.  We also get them food stamps because lots of older people do not have enough food to eat. That's important.
