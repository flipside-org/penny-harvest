Organization's overview
Life in New York City is tough for many kids.  Every day, many have to deal with crime, drugs, abuse or not having enough money for food or a place to live. 
 
We want to help.  The Catalog for Giving is a lot like the catalogs you see all the time that sell things.  But our catalog shows the kids in local afterschool programs, and how important these programs are to help the kids learn new skills, work hard, and succeed in life. 
 
Your donation will help us to give money to these afterschool programs to make them stronger and help lots of kids, the same age as you and in your city, who have to deal with hard problems every day. 
 
Since 1994, we have raised more than $10 million and helped almost 100,000 kids.  Please help us to make even more of a difference in the lives of New York City kids.
