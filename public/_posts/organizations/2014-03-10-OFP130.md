Organization's overview
Hugs for Homeless Animals has been helping homeless and displaced animals worldwide since 1996. Our major programs are the Snuggles Project which provides security blankets to shelter animals, the Worldwide Shelter Directory which provides a bridge between the public and animal shelters/rescue organizations, the Worldwide Pet Adoptions which provides a means to increasing animal adoptions and decreasing unnecessary euthanasia, the Worldwide Lost and Found Pets which has proven to be the most respected and reliable lost and found service available, and our Humane World and Humane Benefits programs which help shelters to raise funds to further their work to help the animals in their care. Our outreach programs work to increase understanding and tolerance for animals and their place in our society.
