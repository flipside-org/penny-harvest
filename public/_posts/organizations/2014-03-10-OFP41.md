Organization's overview
Have you ever looked into the frightened, hungry, eyes of a stray cat or dog and wondered what you can do? Bideawee needs kids like you to help us shelter, feed and give medical care to homeless animals. Your pennies will allow us to continue finding homes for over 1,000 animals each year.  Animals, like Jeena, the sweet cat found sealed up in a trash bag and thrown into a dumpster.  When Jeena was brought to Bideawee she had painful, oozing sores all over her body where someone had burned her. The medical staff gently treated her and eventually the fur grew back and Jeena repaid their kindness with cuddles and cat hugs. Jeena was adopted out to a wonderful family and she will never be tossed away again.   Miracles like this happen everyday at Bideawee.  If you want to be part of this dedicated team of animal lovers visit our website, www.bideawee.org for more stories and follow ups.
