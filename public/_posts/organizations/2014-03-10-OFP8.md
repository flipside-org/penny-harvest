Organization's overview
Mission Statement  The Alley Pond Environmental Center (APEC) is  dedicated to establishing an awareness, understanding and appreciation of the environment and the responsibilities associated with preserving the environment in an urban setting.   Our mission is accomplished primarily through:  1. Providing education and awareness programs for all constituents of the community, utilizing the Wetlands habitat and nature preserve of Alley Pond Park, which we manage and maintain, as a learning center and environmental laboratory.  2. Building a broad constituency for the preservation and protection of park lands and open spaces, like Alley Pond Park, so that we may pass on an enhanced natural heritage to future generations.  3. Advocating for progressive environmental policies and practices that are consistent with a more sustainable urban environment and environmentally sound life style in the home, school and work place.
