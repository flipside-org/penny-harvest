Organization's overview
Integrated multicultural schools are teaching Arab and Jewish  
students how to create a more peaceful future. In Israel, Jewish  
and Arab children grow up with war, fear, and  
hatred of the other.  There is little opportunity to meet each other, because they mostly attend separate schools, live in different villages and only play with kids they know.  Of the 6 million Israeli citizens, 20% are Arabs and 80% are Jews. 
 
In the Hand in Hand public schools, Arab and Jewish  
children learn each other’s language and about each other’s  
culture and heritage.  This next generation will be prepared to  
create a more peaceful future in Israel and elsewhere. 
One Thousand students, from Preschool through High School, are  
now enrolled in four bilingual and multicultural Hand in Hand  
schools.  The schools are also making an impact in many  
communities, among local and international leaders and  
demonstrating that Jews and Arabs are creating a more peaceful  
future together.   
 
These award-winning schools are teaching students mutual  
understanding as well as pride in their own heritage.  The students are taught to respect different opinions and perspectives as well as the common humanity that we share.
