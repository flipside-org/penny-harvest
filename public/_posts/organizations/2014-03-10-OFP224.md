Organization's overview
Being homeless is really scary and it can be hard to get your life back on track when you have no place to live. Project Renewal helps homeless men and women in New York City leave the streets and start a new life in a new home. In addition to housing, we provide health care, addiction treatment, and job training -- everything a homeless person needs to get well!
