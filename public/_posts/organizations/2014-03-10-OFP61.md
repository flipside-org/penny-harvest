Organization's overview
www.facebook.com/childrenofpromisenyc Children of  
Promise, NYC (CPNYC) provides services to  
children who have a parent in prison or jail. Our agency  
is located in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, which is a  
neighborhood where a lot of kids have a parent in prison.  
We have an after-school program, a summer camp, a  
mentoring program and counseling services for all of the  
children. There are over 200 kids in our program, every  
year, and they get tutoring, homework help, sports,  
dance, art and trips. The kids have a lot of fun but more  
importantly, they get love, support and positive attention  
from adults who really care about them.  All of the  
children at CPNYC have had very difficult life experiences  
and we help them to feel better, to do well in school and  
to believe in themselves.
