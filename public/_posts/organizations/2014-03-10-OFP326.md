Organization's overview
Children of China Pediatrics Foundation is an organization  
that provides surgery and medical care for disabled and  
sick orphans in China. Since 1998, our doctors and nurses  
have volunteered their time and money to provide life- 
changing surgeries to over 600 orphans from all over China  
who would not have otherwise received help. We have  
helped hundreds more children through non-surgical  
medical treatment plans as well as training to Chinese  
doctors.
