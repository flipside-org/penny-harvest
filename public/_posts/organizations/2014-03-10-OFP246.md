Organization's overview
Since our founding in 1872, RNH has partnered with Riverdale residents to build and sustain a healthy and productive community, with a special focus on our children.  We have Early Childhood programs, After School programs, Teens,Seniors and Family Center groups.  Our connection with the common Cents program is with P.S.81 and our After School Program working together to make sandwiches for the homeless.
