Organization's overview
How would you feel if your neighbors lost their home due to a fire? Wouldn't you want to help? I am sure that you will feel better to know that you can by helping the Red Cross help others. We help families after a disaster, such as a fire, by providing food, housing and clothing. We also offer CPR and First Aid classes that teach you how to help others in case of an emergency.
