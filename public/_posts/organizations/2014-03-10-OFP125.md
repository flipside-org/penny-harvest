Organization's overview
When children get cancer it affects the whole family so  
Hope & Heroes makes it possible to treat the whole child  
and the whole family. Funds raised touch every aspect of  
the children's cancer program at Columbia University  
Medical Center in upper Manhattan. From scientific  
research to programs that give kids and their families  
access to massage, acupuncture, aromatherapy and  
other helpful treatments, there are many ways that Hope  
& Heroes helps.
