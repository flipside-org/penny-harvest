Organization's overview
Do you like animals? Do you live with a pet?

 
Well every year about 36,000 pets are brought to the city shelter because they are homeless or their owners couldn't keep them.  
 
Our goal is to find homes for all healthy and friendly pets by working as a team with other rescue groups.  
 
Since 2003, we have saved the lives of more than 230,000 NYC dogs and cats! 
 
One of our programs that helps us reach this goal is our Wheels of Hope animal transport program. 
 
Wheels of Hope provides transportation for thousands of New York City animals, bringing them to foster and adoptive homes, veterinary offices and rescue groups. It allows for the transportation of dozens of animals at once - at no cost to the rescue groups - in our City where this would otherwise not be possible. 
 
With more money and resources we can help even more pets in NYC.
