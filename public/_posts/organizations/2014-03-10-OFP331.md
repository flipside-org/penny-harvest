Organization's overview
USACF was created to help in the education of African children. USACF fills 40-foot containers with library books, textbooks, school supplies, sports equipment, sneakers and toys and ships them to Africa. To date USACF has sent 19 containers to Africa. USACF supports the education of more than 70,000 children in Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and South Africa. In Zimbabwe more than half the children in our schools are orphans. USACF also repairs school furniture so children can learn with dignity. Our web site is www.thechildrensfellowship.org
