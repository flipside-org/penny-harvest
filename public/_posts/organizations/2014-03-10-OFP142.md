Organization's overview
Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, widely recognized as one 

of New York’s premier nonprofit organizations, is a 119- 
year-old settlement house that provides an extensive  
array of effective and integrated human services—social,  
educational, legal, health, housing, mental health,  
nutritional and fitness—which significantly improve the  
lives of 20,000 people in need each year, ages 3 to 103,  
on the East Side of Manhattan. Operating out of five East  
Side sites, we serve more than 20,000 people in need  
each year who live, work or go to school on Manhattan’s  
East Side and on Roosevelt Island.  The people we help  
include older adults, homeless and formerly homeless  
adults, children and families, recent immigrants, disabled  
persons and thousands more.  We have a 117-year  
history rich in community activism and innovation,  
addressing important problems such as the lack of  
affordable housing and the needs of an aging population.   
Founded in 1894 as a free kindergarten for the children  
of nearby immigrant factory workers, we remain  
dedicated to improving the quality of life for all  
individuals and families in need in our community.
