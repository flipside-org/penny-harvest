Organization's overview
Mount Gilead Baptist Church is a missionary church. That means we believe that people are the mission that Christ came to save. People in need were the center focus of Christâ€™s ministry. We at Mount Gilead strive to fulfill the mission of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and lifting up those who have fallen down. We do this first with love and then with meeting some of the practical needs of individuals. We are blessed solely to be a blessing to others.
