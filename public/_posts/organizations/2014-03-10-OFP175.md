Organization's overview
In New York City, more than one in four children live in homes that do not always have access to enough safe and nutritious food. More than 1.2 million New Yorkers, including these children, do not have enough money to feed themselves and their families. They face the hard choice between paying for food and rent; food and medicine; food and school books. The New York City Coalition Against Hunger (NYCCAH) works with New York City's over 1,100 soup kitchens and food pantries to make sure New Yorkers have enough to eat.  Since 1983 we have helped hundreds of food pantries and soup kitchens receive more food and money, and have created programs to help move many low-income New Yorkers out of poverty so they can provide for their families.
