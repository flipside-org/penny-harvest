Organization's overview
Ryan’s Well Foundation has two goals – BUILD and EMPOWER 
1.	Build water, sanitation and hygiene education projects.  Our focus is on isolated communities of East and West Africa and Haiti.  To date, we have completed over 700 wells in 16 countries – always in partnership with the local community to ensure sustainability – bringing access to clean water and sanitation to over 736,000 people. 
2.	Empower others to make a difference.  Ryan’s story is compelling – not only within the context of the global water and sanitation crisis – but also as motivation for all of us to take action.  Now an undergraduate student, Ryan continues to inspire people of all ages – youth in particular – to make a positive change in the world.
