Organization's overview
Friends of Historic New Utrecht's mission is to restore, preserve and provide education to the community about why the New Utrecht neighborhood is important in history. Our neighborhood was very important in the founding of Brookyn and so we want to people to know about it. Our major programs are continuing support for the restoration of the New Utrecht Reformed Church and maintenance of the Old New Utrecht Cemetery. Our annual events make history fun and let children show their talents. We host a community concert series with many student performances. We bring President Abraham Lincoln to Brooklyn. We also give a live demonostration of what the Revolutionary War was like during our Liberty Weekend celebration. Many schools bring their students.  If you would like, we can also give you a tour of our historic sites. All of our programs are free but we need your support to keep them going.
