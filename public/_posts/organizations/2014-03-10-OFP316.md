Organization's overview
JDRF was founded in 1970 by some parents of kids with diabetes. Since it began, JDRF has only been about one thing: finding a cure for diabetes.  Many children with type 1 Diabetes rely on insulin to manage the disease but insulin is not a cure and it does not prevent the disease or its devestating effects, which can include kidney failure, blindness,and even heart disease. 
JDRF's mission is to find a cure for diabetes and its complications through the support of research and lots of it!
