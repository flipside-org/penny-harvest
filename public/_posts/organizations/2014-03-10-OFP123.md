Organization's overview
The Holy Child Outreach Mission and Food Pantry 
  
Our mission follows in the footsteps of St. Vincent de Paul  
in being dedicated to assisting those in need and seeking  
charity and justice.  We strive to provide social outreach  
services to members of the community who are in need.  
  
The mission provides various services such as food for  
the needy, social service information and referrals,  
transportation for the elderly, shelter placement and  
housing assistance information, and job exchange.  
  
Through the financial support and food donations of the  
parishioners of the parish, this ministry provides  
outreach to ALL members of the community regardless of  
race, gender or religion.
