Organization's overview
Council for Unity is a not-for-profit organization that started as an anti-gang coalition and later took on the mantle of a broader issue, violence.  The word gang has many different meanings and connotations to different people. A broad definition of the word gang is a group of people that, for a variety of different reasons, share a common identity. Youth tend to be attracted to gangs because of the need to belong. Whether we like to recognize it or not, gangs give our youth what they believe to be a family setting that they may be lacking, or feel they are lacking, in their home life for a variety of reasons. Everyday we strive to make students realize that a family which requires you to commit a violent act is no family at all. The Council for Unity seeks to provide youth with the ideal that they are striving for, a family. We offer curricula for students in elementary, junior high and high school. Our curriculum is our program. Curricula is the plural version of curriculum. 

The Council for Unity is an organization that is one of only a few dedicated to stopping violent activity. However, we rely on donations to subsist and we need your help to keep these programs alive.
