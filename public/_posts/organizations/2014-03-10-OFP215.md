Organization's overview
Project Hawai'i is a nonprofit organization that runs 100% by volunteers. We provide year round services to the children living homeless in poverty situations. Our agency is solely supported by public donations, which means we do not have government or other grants to help the children. 
We provide children with basic life needs, like food, healthy hot meals, clothing, educational supplies, summer camp, holiday parties, etc.
