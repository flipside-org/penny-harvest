Organization's overview
Have you ever really, really loved a book? Many blind children would never know the feeling of falling in love with their own braille books without the help of Seedlings Braille Books for Children!  Seedlings has made it possible for blind children to have their very own braille book.  We make braille books for children who read with the tips of their fingers.  Seedlings has over 1,300 titles in braille for blind children to choose from at a very low cost. Many of the popular bookstores do not sell braille books. Other places sell them at a very high cost, so blind children have to borrow them from a library.  At Seedlings, we sell our braille books at a very low price so families can afford to buy them.  Seedlings also has many programs where books are given away free.  It is very important for all children, both blind and sighted, to learn to read and enjoy books at an early age.  Seedlings is making a difference in the lives of those special children who read by touch.
