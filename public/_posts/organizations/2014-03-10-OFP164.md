Organization's overview
Music Outreach brings creative approaches to learning for special needs children in Early Childhood classes in elementary schools across the City.  Our series of Music & Literacy Workshops creates a learning environment of wonder, imagination, and joy through instrumental demonstrations, songs and award-winning stories that are set to original musical accompaniment.  Children actively participate in musical games, listening exercises, singing, conducting and using percussive instruments.  The Workshops are presented by professional career musicians who are skilled in communicating with children and have a gift for bringing laughter to the learning process.  The Workshops tap into children's natural abilities and ensure that every child has a successful and positive learning experience.  Each workshop is approximately one hour long.
