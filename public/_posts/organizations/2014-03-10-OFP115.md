Organization's overview
For 30 Years Happiness Is Camping has provided free sleepaway camp for boys and girls with cancer. We give kids fighting this terrible illness the opportunity to be "regular kids" away at camp and climb a tower, jump in the pool, play sports, all with the best medical care possible. Camp docs and nurses can even do chemo which allows really sick kids the chance to attend.
