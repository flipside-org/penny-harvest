Organization's overview
Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people across 

the country; everyday, people find out that someone  
they know - their mother, father, sister, cousin, or  
grandparent - has this terrible disease. Memorial Sloan- 
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) treats all these cancer  
patients - including kids who have cancer - with the best  
care possible. We also conduct research to find a cure,  
so that no one has to lose a loved one to cancer. MSKCC  
depends on the support of generous people of all types -  
including kids - to help us keep up the fight against  
cancer.
