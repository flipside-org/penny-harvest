Organization's overview
Not all children have soap to clean themselves, toys to play with, pencils and paper for school,  or even medicine to make them feel better. 

 
Save the Children helps by giving children and familiesâ€™ food, places to go after a disaster, and medical care for babies and children. We are working with over 37 million children all over the world to make them happier, healthier and safer.
