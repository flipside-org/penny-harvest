Organization's overview
Started at the suggestion of a 5-year-old boy in New 

York City , The New York Says Thank You Foundation  
sends volunteers from New York City each year on the  
9/11 Anniversary to help rebuild communities around the country affected by disasters.  
 
This year, we made a promise to help rebuild 200 homes of NYC First-Responders (FDNY/EMT, NYPD, DSNY and volunteer firefighters) affected by Hurricane Sandy. As of March 19th, we have helped rebuild 29 homes - 171 more to go! 
We would love to have the NYC School kids support in getting these brave men and women & their families back home!
