Organization's overview
If you are a wild animal or bird, New York City is a hard place to live.  If you are injured or ill, who will take care of you?  The Wild Bird Fund treated over 1,300 creatures last year alone.  We mend broken bones, give medicine, feed orphaned babies and get our feathered and furry patients ready to be released back into the wild.
