Organization's overview
The ASPCA has been saving animals for 143 years.  We make sure that people do not abuse animals.  We also make sure that homeless dogs and cats are adopted into caring, forever homes.  The ASPCA saves animals by collecting evidence in cruelty cases; making sure that those who do abuse animals either go to jail or pay a fine; educating people on how to care for their pets properly and with compassion; assisting those who cannot pay for spay/neuter surgeries, adoption, and veterinary services by giving them the services for less than what we normally charge or for free.
