Organization's overview
For over 20 years PCI-Media Impact has been dedicated to helping people in need.  What we do is try to find out what problems are happening in our surrounding countries.  We have worked with over 27 countries, including China, India, Latin America, and Africa.  Once we've identified an important problem (like hunger, immigration, women and children's rights, or environment clean up) PCI-Media Impact comes up with a plan to help the people that are suffering from a problem.  Once a plan is formed we make it into a radio program.  PCI-Media Impact flies to the country in need of their help and teaches the local community members how to start a radio show.  The radio show deals with the certain problem that community is facing.  For example if a community is having a problem with environmental cleanliness, the radio program will talk about a farmer and his family and will discuss ways that the farmer can keep his earth clean.  PCI-Media Impact also makes sure that the community is taught how to run the radio program even when PCI-Media leaves to come back to NYC.  We want to help communities in need and also make sure that they can continue to help themselves.
