Organization's overview
Sometimes people are born developmentally disabled.  That means they will always need extra help to learn and do things.  When they grow up and finish school, sometimes they still need extra help to learn doing simple everyday things that you and I already know how to do.  At Lifestyles for the Disabled, we help them learn to do things like clearing & wiping the table, washing dishes, and helping around the house.  Sometimes we help them to go see a movie, go bowling or going out to a restaurant to eat with friends.  At Lifestyles for the Disabled we also have many work programs they can do during the day  like doing laundry, or cooking and serving in a real restaurant, or growing flowers and plants to make homes, schools and hospitals in Staten Island prettier.
