Organization's overview
The Coalition for Asian American Children and Families (CACF) is the nation's only Asian Pacific American children's advocacy organization.  We have been helping children and families for over 25 years.  We believe that children of all backgrounds should have an equal chance to grow up healthy and safe adn should live in a society free from discrimination and prejudice.  Our goal is to improve the lives of Asian Pacific American children and families in New York City.  We help many families, but especially families who struggling with poverty, families who have just moved to America, and families who know little to no English.  We try to improve their lives by fighting for better laws, funding, and services.  Our mission is to make sure that children from all backgrounds have an equal chance to grow up healthy and safe.
