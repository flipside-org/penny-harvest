Organization's overview
Prevent Child Abuse America has been working, since  
1972, to prevent child abuse and neglect from ever  
happening in our country.  We do research to see which  
prevention methods actually work, and then we share  
what we know with people all over the country.  We also  
educate policy-makers, such as senators, congressmen,  
and the president, about what policies will protect  
children.  We have a direct service program, Healthy  
Families America, which provides support to families with  
young children.  With extra support, parents are less  
likely to take stress out on their kids.  We hope our  
efforts will eventually make child abuse and neglect  
something that just doesn't happen, ever, in our country.   
We hope you will support us in this great cause!
