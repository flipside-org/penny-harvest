Organization's overview
Do you know anyone, or do you have a friend, who sometimes needs extra help learning or socializing? Most of us do.

    The Staten Island Mental Health Society is there to assist these children and teenagers who have special needs. We provide programs and supportive services for Staten Island youngsters with emotional problems, developmental disabilities,  educational weaknesses, and/or economic disadvantages, as well as for their families. Our 21 award-winning programs,  at 25 locations throughout the Island, assisted more than 5,000 children last year. 
   Our services include counseling, special education, after-school and summer programs, drug and alcohol prevention and treatment, academic tutoring, child abuse prevention, parent skills training, and Head Start and daycare centers for preschoolers from needy families. 
    We also run two volunteer programs for mainstream children who may be suffering from low self-esteem. Those who need extra help learning to read benefit from our School Reading Volunteer Program, while our Staten Island Children's Theatre Association brings children's cultural arts to our borough and offers training in musical theatre.
