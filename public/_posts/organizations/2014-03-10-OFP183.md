Organization's overview
Bzzzzzzzzzz! Have you ever been bitten by as mosquito? In the U.S, mosquitoes are annoying; but in many countries in Africa, they spread a disease called malaria that kills a child every 30 seconds and over one million people every year. A simple way to prevent and protect these children from malaria is to use a bed net. Bed nets stop mosquitoes from biting at night and from spreading malaria. Nothing But Nets sends bed nets to children and their families in Africa to prevent them from getting this deadly disease.
