Organization's overview
Our foundation helps families and children affected by Rett syndrome.  Rett syndrome mainly affects little girls and takes away their ability to talk, walk, use their hands as well as brings on many health issues.  Our foundation raises money to fund research to find a cure for this disease as well as support the families who have a child with Rett syndrome.
