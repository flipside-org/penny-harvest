The Blacksmith Institute is an international non-profit  
organization that identifies and cleans up the worlds most  
polluted sites. Our focus is toxic pollution, which directly  
harms humans, as opposed to the pollution stemming  
from cars. We deal with issues like lead poisoning and  
high levels of mercury that cause children to develop  
severe brain damage and learning disabilities.
