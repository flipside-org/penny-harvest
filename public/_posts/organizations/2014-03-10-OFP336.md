Organization's overview
Uniting Against Lung Cancer (Uniting) funds innovative  
lung cancer research to find a cure for the nation's  
leading cancer killer. We also work to increase  
awareness of the disease, including in people who have  
never smoked. 
 
Since 2003, Uniting Against Lung Cancer (UALC) has  
awarded over $10 million to the brightest scientists in the  
field. Work funded by UALC has impacted currently  
approved treatments for many lung cancer patients and  
has led to a number of ongoing clinical trials testing new  
therapies.  Through its partners across the country, UALC  
is able to make critical strides in lung cancer research,  
improving patient treatment options and survival rates  
for the 226,000 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients.
