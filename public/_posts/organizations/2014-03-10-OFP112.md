Organization's overview
Hale House Center, Inc. is dedicated to giving children and families the tools to excel and build better futures for themselves.  Hale House is a non-profit organization that believes in providing love, care, education and understanding—unconditionally—to infants, children, and families in need of support.  Our Harlem-based programs offer a safe, nurturing environment and an opportunity for a better future through individualized support and educational services.  Our programs include a state of the art Learning Center, a Transitional Housing Program for formerly homeless single parents and their children and community outreach.  These programs are so popular and so much in need that Hale House has over 300 children on the waiting list for the Learning Center and must turn away families seeking shelter because we are filled to capacity.
