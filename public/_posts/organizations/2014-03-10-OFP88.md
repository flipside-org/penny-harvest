Organization's overview
We send very large care packages to soldiers, marines, 

sailors, and airmen who are serving in war zones. These  
packages contain notes and letters from people across  
the US as well as snack food, toiletries, socks, and other  
needed items. These packages encourage our troops by  
letting them know people at home appreciate their hard  
work and courage.
