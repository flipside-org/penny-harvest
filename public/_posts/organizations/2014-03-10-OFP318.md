Organization's overview
THE POINT CDC is a positive safe space for youth from 6- 
24 years of age.  We offer after school and Saturday  
programs in the areas of arts and culture, social and  
environmental justice, and youth and community  
development.  Programs that we offer include social  
circus, hip-hop dance and music production, instrument  
workshops, black and white photography, aquaponics,  
young women and men leadership, capoiera, spoken  
word, culinary arts, radio production, social justice,  
muraling, college prep, and academics support amongst  
others.  We are a free program that is open to youth  
from 3-830PM Monday through Friday from October  
through June.  We also offer summer camp opportunities  
for youth 9 through 21.  We pride ourselves on being a  
space where young people have a say in their own  
transformation as well as that of their community.
