Organization's overview
Starlight Childrenâ€™s Foundation NY*NJ*CT exists to brighten the lives of seriously ill children.  Our programs are designed to restore some of the laughter and happiness that a serious illness takes away from children and allow them to experience some of the simple joys of childhood.
