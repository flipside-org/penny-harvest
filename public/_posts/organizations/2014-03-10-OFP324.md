Organization's overview
The Salvation Army is a Christian Church which was first established in England and has been in existance since 1865.  We want to show God's love to the world and now we are in over 120 countries!  At the Bay Ridge Corps in Brooklyn, New York we help others in many ways like: Giving out school supplies to kids who need them.  Supplying food to families in need. Supplying breakfast, and clothing and a hot shower to the homeless in the area.  Toys for children 12 and under for Christmas.  Turkeys to the elderly and families for Thanksgiving holiday.
