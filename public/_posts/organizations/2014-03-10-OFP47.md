Organization's overview
The mission of the Books for Kids Foundation is to promote 

literacy among all children with a special emphasis on low- 
income and at-risk preschool-aged children. Books for Kids  
creates libraries, donates books, and partners with literacy  
programs to develop the critical early foundation and skills  
which young children need to be successful in life.
