Organization's overview
Do you know anyone who has ever been teased or bullied at school? If you have, Smile Train needs support from kids like you to help kids around the world born with cleft lip and palate! Left out of games and fun because they look different, kids who are born with this birth defect can't go to school, play, smile (a lot of things we take for granted) and are excluded and shunned by their community. Since we use local doctors in 84 countries around the world, these kids can get free treatment 365 days out of the year. Surgery costs as little as $250 and takes as little as 45 minutes. We canâ€™t wait for you to get on board with Smile Train to help these kids!
