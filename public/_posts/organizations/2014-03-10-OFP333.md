Organization's overview
Ubuntu Education Fund works in the townships of Port  
Elizabeth, South Africa. The children and families we  
work with have been devastated by the AIDS epidemic,  
poverty, and an unfair legal system called Apartheid,  
which denied them their basic rights, such as access to  
education and health care.  We provide vulnerable and  
orphaned children with comprehensive educational  
resources and life-saving health services. Specifically, we  
provide our children with academic resources, such as  
libraries and computers, free medical care, holiday  
camps, after school programs, support groups, career  
guidance, scholarships to go to university, and job  
opportunities. We also offer HIV/AIDS testing, treatment,  
and support.
