Organization's overview
Redemption Outreach Intl inc is a community based non- 
for profit organization. It was founded in 2002 as a focus  
group discussion in response to the problems and the  
needs of  
the poor, sick, weak, and less privileged. Recognizing  
that  
the New York minority community has a high rate of  
diseases  
and social problems, Redemption Outreach joined other  
organizations to reduce the spread of diseases and social  
problems. These diseases and social problems include  
STD,  
HIV/AIDS, teen pregnancy, high risk behavior and  
bullying.
