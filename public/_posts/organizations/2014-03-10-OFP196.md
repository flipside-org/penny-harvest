Organization's overview
Outlet is a program that creates a safe place for young people between the ages of 11-24, who get bullied for being gay or acting gay. We also educate teachers and other adults who work with all kinds of young people to understand how to help kids be kind to each other. CHAC has many counselors who also help young children and their families get along.
