Organization's overview
West Side Campaign Against Hunger (WSCAH) helps hungry New Yorkers by providing a supermarket style food pantry, where customers in need select free food they can cook at home.  In 2011, we provided 110,000 people with food for over one million meals.  Each day we provide sufficient food for about 5,000 meals.  In 1993, WSCAH pioneered the customer choice food pantry and customer cooperative model.  We have been visited by food pantries throughout the United States, many of which have gone on to use our model.
