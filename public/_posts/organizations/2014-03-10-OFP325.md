Organization's overview
The Sunset Park Reach Out and Read program is Lutheran Family Health Centers'  literacy project providing over 6,000 pre-school children with books and literacy programming.  Dedicated to building the  literacy skills of Brooklyn children ages 6 months to 5 years old, Reach Out and Read encourages parents to read with their children. Doctors, family health center staff and outreach volunteers promote healthy early language and literacy development in  preschool children from diadvantaged backgrounds by:  
 
·Strengthening parents’ skills in supporting their young child’s early language and literacy development 
·Providing books to families with children ages 6 months through 5 years old to bring books into the home to keep. 
·Providing families with opportunities for literacy activities through regular literacy programming and story telling by trained community volunteers  
·Linking families to community literacy resources and services 
 
Each year, the Sunset Park ROR program distributes over 14,000 books and our volunteers read to over 5,000 Brooklyn children!
