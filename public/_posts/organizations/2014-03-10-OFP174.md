Organization's overview
Founded in 1970, the New York Center for Interpersonal Development (NYCID) is a not-for-profit, community-based organization that provides youth, community, professional development and dispute resolution services.  Our goal is to educate and inform the community about constructive problem-solving, effective communication, violence prevention and intercultural awareness, while also operating a training institute to teach these skills to others.
