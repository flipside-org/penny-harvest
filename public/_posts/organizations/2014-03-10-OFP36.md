Organization's overview
There are 10,000 kids in families that are very poor,  
sick and hungry in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and  
Peru.  They drink contaminated water and eat very little  
food.  Most don't attend school. They live in small shacks  
with no electricity. At Batey Relief Alliance, we help by  
giving them medical care, food and medicines, clothing  
and school supplies. 
 
Since the earthquake devastated Haiti in January 2010,  
many kids have lost their arms and legs. They are  
suffering because they have no hospitals and medicines.  
They live on the streets with their families because their  
homes are destroyed and have no food to eat. 
 
Some kids are weak and very sick with HIV/AIDS, which  
is a disease that attacks the parts of your body that help  
you get better. They have no one to care for them  
because both of their parents have died of AIDS. Batey  
Relief Alliance gives them special care and medicines to  
make them feel better so they can play with other kids  
and go to school. 
 
A lot of these kids live in poor neighboods that are also  
dangerous because of crimes, drugs and violence.
