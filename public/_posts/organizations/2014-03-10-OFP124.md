Organization's overview
Homes for the Homeless (HFH) is the nation’s largest 

provider of residential, education and employment  
training centers—serving over  500 homeless families  
and over 700 homeless children each day at  four  
separate sites across New York City. Dubbed American  
Family Inns, these sites function as communities of  
opportunity, carefully integrating a network of on-site  
education, employment and family support services that  
address the multiple causes of homelessness.
