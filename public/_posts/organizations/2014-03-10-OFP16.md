Organization's overview
The American Lung Association was established to help people with lung disease lead heathier lives and prevent people from getting sick with lung diseases like asthma and diseases caused by cigarette smoking or air pollution.   We offer programs to help adults and children learn about asthma, avoid cigarettes and clean up the air.  Additionally, we support research into the causes of different kinds of lung diseases so doctors can improve treatment and hopefully, stop certain diseases.
