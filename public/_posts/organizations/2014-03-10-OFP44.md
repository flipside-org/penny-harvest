Organization's overview
Black Girls Rock wants all girls to be happy and healthy.   
But when music videos, movies and magazines show women in a negative way, it can hurt young girls and their self-esteem.  Black Girls Rock encourages people to think and talk about this issue and helps young girls by introducing them to positive role models to be their mentors.    
 
Black Girls Rock was started by a woman DJ and fashion model named Beverly Bond.  Beverly has performed for Prince, Jay-Z, Diddy, Britney Spears, Martha Stewart, and Michael Jordan.  She is proud to be a positive role model for the young girls in the Black Girls Rock mentoring program, and teaches them how to deejay at the Scratch DJ Academy in Manhattan.
