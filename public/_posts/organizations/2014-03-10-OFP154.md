Organization's overview
Our mission is to provide supportive services to families of children diagnosed with a brain or spinal cord tumor, before surgery, during the hospital stay, and after the children returns home, to help them cope with the fear, anxiety and stress of hospitalization, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation while funding research that will lead to a cure.
