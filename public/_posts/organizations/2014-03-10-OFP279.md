Organization's overview
The mission of St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. No child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family's ability to pay. No family ever pays St. Jude for anything.
