Organization's overview
QHC Dept of Pediatrics provides healthcare to predominantly poor youngsters from birth through 21 years of age.  As part of our mission of preventive care and promoting healthy lifestyles and education, we have become a Reach Out and Read Program site.  Through this program, we give out brand new books to children ages 6 months though 5 years of age during their check-ups and teach parents about the importance of reading to their child.  Although a portion of the cost of purchasing books is covered by a Federal Grant, the remainder of the costs must be met through fund-raising efforts.  This year we received a Penny Harvest grant for our ROR Program from PS 155.  Several years ago we received a Penny Harvest grant for purchase of toys for our children's inpatient unit.  We are grateful to all the students who participate in this worthy program.  Additional projects include a pediatric obesity management program where we teach children, teens and families how to live a healthier lifestyle.
