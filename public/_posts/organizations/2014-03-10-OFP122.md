Organization's overview
The mission of the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen (HASK) is to feed the hungry, to comfort the afflicted, to seek justice for the homeless, and to counsel and provide a sense of hope and opportunity to those in need.    HASK’s Emergency Feeding program provides hot and nutritious meals every Monday through Friday from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. HASK’s Counseling and Referrals Services provides assistance typically for shelter, clothing, food pantry, alcohol and drug rehabilitation, AIDS prevention and treatment information, employment, and for obtaining public benefits.    A majority of our clients (guests) are homeless and jobless African-American and Hispanic men, aged 18-44.   In 2004 HASK served more meals than in any single year of our 22-year history -- 296,505, or an average each weekday of 1,132! Our Counseling and Referrals (C&R) Services also served a record number in 2004 when we held 5,016 information, counseling and referrals sessions.
