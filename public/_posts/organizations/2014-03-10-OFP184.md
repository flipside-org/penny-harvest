Organization's overview
It is unfair that in one of the world’s richest cities, children don't have nice clothes to wear to school or even a warm winter coat. 
 
We provide new fashionable clothing that helps children fit in and allows them to focus on succeeding in school and in their future. 
 
HOW WE WORK: New clothing and toys are sorted and prepared to be given away at New York City Clothing Bank’s Brooklyn warehouse.  We than give it to 225 partner agencies come collect these items the same way you get money from your local bank.  The partners serve approximately 80,000 homeless and low-income men, women and children in all five boroughs, .  We also provide clothing to victims of emergencies such as fires, crane collapses to even planes landing in the Hudson River.
