Organization's overview
There are over 12.4 million hungry children in America.   
Every day, almost 16,000 children across the world die  
from hunger-related causes.  At WhyHunger, we believe that nobody should be hungry, especially when there is so much food available.   
 
In our fight to end world hunger, WhyHunger does three  
things:  First, we answer calls to the National Hunger  
Hotline, which tells people who are hungry where they  
can find free food.  Second, we help people who are  
hungry get an education, find jobs or find childcare so  
that eventually they can work and earn enough money to  
buy food.  Finally, we try to make the world more fair so  
that people wonâ€™t be hungry in the first place.  For  
example, WhyHunger tells big supermarket companies  
that they should sell fresh fruits and vegetables in their  
stores that come from nearby farms.  This would mean  
that healthy food is available at affordable prices to  
everybody.    
 
WhyHunger was founded in 1975 by the late singer,  
Harry Chapin, and Bill Ayres, who is our current  
Executive Director.
