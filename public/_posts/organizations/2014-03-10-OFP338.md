Organization's overview
Every year, Volunteers of America runs a community service campaign called Operation Backpack. Operation Backpack collects new backpacks and school supplies for children who live in homeless shelters in NYC. Without our help, many of these children would go back to school without any school supplies. Our backpacks ensure they have everything they need, and that they feel good about going back to school!
