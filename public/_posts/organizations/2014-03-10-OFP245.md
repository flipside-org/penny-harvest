Organization's overview
Kids say - "RCC is the place to be!!!"  Young people, such as yourself, who have nowhere to go after school find a home away from home at the Riverdale Community Center.  The attend our free after school center and enjoy such activities as Step/Stomp, Hip Hop Dance, Theater, Painting, Basketball, Flag Rugby, and other great stuff.   Kids can do their homework in our computer lab or library.  And, on school holidays and breaks we sponsor field trips to many different places such as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum.  Won't you help us make a difference in the life of a child.
