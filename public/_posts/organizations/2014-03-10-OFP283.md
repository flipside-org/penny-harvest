Organization's overview
SIPH sends packages overseas to our military in Iraq, Afghanistan & kuwait every 6 weeks. We send to the men, women & K-9 Units. We pay full price for all our shipping. We don't get any discounts. We are all volunteers, and any monies that we receive go directly to our shipping cost.
