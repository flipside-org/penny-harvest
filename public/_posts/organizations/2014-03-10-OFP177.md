Organization's overview
The New York Foundling has been helping children and families for more than 140 years. We provide homes for almost 1400 children who are unable to be with their families. About 125 children are adopted through The New York Foundling every year.

 
Our Crisis Nursery provides a safe haven for up to 21 days for children whose families are are in a state of crisis. 
 
Many of our children will attend our sleep-away camp this summer and are attending our charter school Haven Academy in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx which happens to be the poorest neighborhood in the United States.
