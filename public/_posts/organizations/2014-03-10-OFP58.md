Organization's overview
Charley is a fun-loving, vibrant 10-year old boy who  
loves to play basketball, baseball and joke around with  
his brother Sammy, sister Maisy and his yellow lab  
Stella.  At 3 1/2 years old, Charley was diagnosed with  
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a fatal muscle  
wasting disease that affects only children.   
    
Here are a few facts: 
 
•  DMD is the most common fatal genetic disease to  
affect children around the world. 
 
•  DMD affects one in every 3,500 boys. 
 
•  Children with DMD are confined to wheelchairs by  
adolescence and die before they reach adulthood. 
 
•  There currently is no treatment or cure for DMD. 
 
•  DMD is 100% fatal. 
 
Charley's Fund is racing the clock to find a treatment and  
cure for this cruel disease.  Thanks to Charley's Fund and  
the research it is funding, for the first time, THERE IS  
HOPE!   
 
With your help, Charley and the 60,000 other boys just  
like him may live into adulthood and have families of  
their own. 
 
We at Charley's Fund would be ever so grateful if you  
would select us as your Penny Harvest/Common  
Cents recipient.  We would direct that money right into  
the hands of researchers who have the best shot at  
developing a treatment or cure for Duchenne Muscular  
Dystrophy. 
 
- With many thanks from Charley and all the other DMD  
boys.
