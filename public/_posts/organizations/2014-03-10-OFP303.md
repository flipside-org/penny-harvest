Organization's overview
The Guild for Exceptional Children provides education, homes,clinical services, service coordination, recreation and after-school services to infants, children and adults with developmental disabilities. The Guild was founded in 1958, and has grown to serve nearly 1000 people each day. Here at the Guild, we believe that every person has talents and abilities. It is our mission to provide the education and supports so that people with learning challenges can triumph over those challenges and live full and meaningful lives. The people in our care learn new skills and become more independent while they give back to the community.  They help provide meals to senior citizens; help make Brooklyn "Greener" through our Greenhouse Program and recycling efforts; and volunteer at many Brooklyn sites where they help other people in need.  Your contribution helps the people in our care as well as others in the community, and we are very proud of our success.
