Organization's overview
We are a health care facility for people over the age of 18.  We provide nursing care, rehabilitation, activities, and meals for our residents.  Additionally, we have community programs where we care for people who need medical care, but live at home. We also have a children's day care center and a community program for people over 50 years old that like to go on trips, events, and workshops.  We even train people for free and then hire them to become Home Health Aides and Certified Nurses Assistants.
