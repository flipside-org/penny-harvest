Organization's overview
Eight week old, adorable puppies are brought into prison 

and paired with specially trained inmates who take care  
of them for the next two years.  As the puppies grow up  
and become well-loved, well-behaved dogs, their inmate  
raisers learn what it means to give to society rather than  
take from it.  The puppies give love to their inmate  
raisers and then go out into the world to either serve  
disabled veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan  
or sniff for explosives in partnership with law  
enforcement in public places like airports.
