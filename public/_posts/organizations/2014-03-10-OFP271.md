Organization's overview
Society of St. Vincent is an organization dedicated to helping those most in need- the poor.  We help many needy New York families through our Food Pantry Network, our Holiday Meal Program at Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, and provide 400 New York City kids an opportunity to attend camp for 1 week.  We also provide burial assistance for those needy families who otherwise could not afford a burial for their loved ones.  The Society of St. Vincent  De Paul's mission is to embrace the world in a network of charity.  We aim to help those who are in need.
