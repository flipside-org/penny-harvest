Organization's overview
Daniel was an infant, living in a drafty, rodent-infested fifth-floor rental walkup in Brooklyn, when he suddenly started wheezing and gasping for breath. He was rushed to the emergency room, where the doctor diagnosed an asthmatic condition caused by the mold in his rundown apartment. Today, thanks to Habitat-NYC, Daniel, now six, lives with his mother, brothers and sisters in their own home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He has not had an asthma attack since the family moved to this safe haven, and last year he donated his $4 allowance to our organization and insisted on coming to our offices with his mother to deliver it himself.

At Habitat-NYC, we believe a simple, decent home is a right, not a privilege. Along with 5,000-7,000 volunteers a year, Habitat families like Daniel's build their own homes, and give a bright coat of paint to community rooms, where neighborhood children play and learn, in our Brush with Kindness program.  Together, we revitalize neighborhoods and transform lives.
