Organization's overview
PETA is the world's largest animal rights organization,  
and we take on anyone who abuses animals. From  
schools that don’t allow the choice not to dissect to  
fashion designers who won’t drop fur to fast-food giants  
that refuse to treat their animals right—if cruelty to  
animals is taking place, you can bet PETA will be on it.  
 
Our goal is to arm you with all the info, literature, advice,  
and stickers you need to get active for animals. If you're  
12 & under, check us out at PETAKids.com. If you're 13 &  
up, peta2.com is the place to be.
