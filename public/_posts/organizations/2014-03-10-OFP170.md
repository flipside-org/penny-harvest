Organization's overview
There are many children in New York City who 

are sometimes so sick, that their parents can not take  
care of them at home.  Many of these children grow up in  
the hospital where they don’t get to experience some of  
the things that are normal for kids, like going to the park  
to play a game or going to the movies.  Some kids have  
spent so much time in the hospital that they don’t even  
remember the feel of sunshine on their face.  New  
Alternatives for Children, Inc. (NAC) was founded on the  
belief that all children, including those who are very ill or  
physically challenged, have the right to live in safe,  
loving, and permanent homes with a family to call their  
own.  We help families care for their children at home  
and away from the hospital so that they can do things  
like go to summer camp, meet with friends, receive  
mentoring and tutoring help and  
eventually even go on to college and get jobs.  NAC  
helps our kids succeed so they can reach their dreams,  
whatever they may be.
