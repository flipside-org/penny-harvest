Organization's overview
How would you feel if you came to a new country, didn't speak the language, couldn't help your children with their homework, and couldn't find a job? The Family Support Center offers a variety of services for people like this, including: classes and job training for adults, therapy for children, education for families about how to stay healthy, and reading classes, leadership, and volunteer opportunities for kids. The people we serve live in southwest Brooklyn.  Most are new immigrants, and come from many different countries. 
 
Right now, we are working on a new project to help children and families.  It's called the Sunset Park Promise Neighborhood.  Our goal is to make sure that all children in the community are healthy and safe and have the tools they need to do well in school and succeed in life.  We are working with about two dozen organizations in Sunset Park as part of the Promise Neighborhood and we are all committed to making families stronger and helping our community.  You can help us reach this goal with your grant to us!
