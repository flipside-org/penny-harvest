Organization's overview
Riverkeeper protects the Hudson River and the water that you drink. Riverkeeper believes that every person can make a difference, and that it is our job to protect the environment, starting with the clean water needed by both humans and wildlife to survive. That's why Riverkeeper uses a patrol boat to travel between New York City and Waterford, 150 miles north, to prevent pollution of the Hudson River.
