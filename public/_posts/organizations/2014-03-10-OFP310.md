Organization's overview
The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society is the world's largest voluntary health organization dedicated to fighting and curing blood cancers like leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and Hodgkin's disease. Through the Pennies for Patients program, we work with schools to educate students about blood cancers and empower them to make change and beat cancer. With leukemia as the #1 cancer diagnosis in children under age 20, we find that schools have been affected by a student or teacher's diagnosis and are enthused to participate because they know they are making a difference in the fight against blood cancers. Funds donated to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society go directly to patient financial support, educational programs, medical research and the development of treatments for blood cancers.
