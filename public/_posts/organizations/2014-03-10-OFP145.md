Organization's overview
Literacy Inc. (LINC) addresses the crisis in literacy facing children living in poverty in New York City. Early childhood programs, family involvement and community support are crucial to developing strong literacy skills which are generally lacking for children growing up in poverty. To combat this problem, LINC developed its Comprehensive Literacy Model, based on research showing that mobilizing three key constituency groups – peers, parents and community members – has a demonstrated impact on early childhood literacy development. Using community based coordinators, LINC works with schools, families, libraries, local businesses, and community partners to create a sustained, coordinated, community-based effort to promote literacy skills for at-risk youth.
