Organization's overview
KittyKaretakers of Queens is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to educating people regarding their responsibilities as guardians of animals (four-legged kids).  We are involved in rescue, adoption and trap-neuter-return of stray and abused cats and kittens.  We have gotten hundreds of animals adopted as well as spayed and neutered.  Our volunteers are school age young adults (with supervision) doing a variety of jobs for our "kids."
