Organization's overview
We took a abandoned 1/2 acre community garden, and made a all natural vegetable garden. We eat what we grow. We also take all the food waste back to the garden and compost it to make healthy soil for more planting. We also hire extra gym teachers to exercise during lunch and afterschool. We also recycle all paper, plastic amd glass in the school. The children love the program.
