Organization's overview
Ozanam Hall of Queens Nursing Home cares for people over the age of 65.  Many are over 100 years old!!  They need special care.  We have many pets that visit them everyday (cats, dogs, rabbits, birds and fish).  The people who work here need special education so that they can do what is best for the Residents of our Home.   We take care of 432 people!!  There are 700 people who work here and help us do it.  We are managed by a group of religious sisters called The Carmelite Sisters for The Aged and Infirm.  Thank you for considering assisting us in this great work!!!
