Organization's overview
Have you ever felt scared that someone would hurt you? Imagine feeling that every day. Some children feel unsafe because their parents hit them or say very mean things to them. Serenity House, operated by the African American Planning Commission, is committed to providing a safe, secret place for children and their moms or children and their dads, when they have to leave home because they are being hit or verbally abused by another adult in the house. Some of the services we provide are: counseling services, making sure the children continue to go to school, helping families find a new place to live permanently away from the abusive parent, helping them make sure they have enough food to eat, and we also provide activities for teenagers, young boys and girls, as well as babies.
