Organization's overview
In 1996, Making Books Sing began as the family theatre and education program of the Tony Award-winning Vineyard Theatre. After five years of steady growth, the Vineyard Theatre’s Founder, Barbara Zinn Krieger, left her post there as Executive Director to establish Making Books Sing as an independent, 501© 3 organization.  Today, she and co-founder, Debra Sue Lorenzen, continue to guide Making Books Sing’s mission:

 
To empower children to experience the performing arts and literature as captivating, accessible vehicles for their imaginations, artistic expression and learning.  
 
Our unique combination of professional musical theatre, high-quality books and hands-on theater education aim to nurture children’s love for theatre and books, and help children grow into literate, creative and socially aware individuals.
