Organization's overview
When people who live with life-altering illnesses become too sick to shop and cook for themselves, Godâ€™s Love We Deliver (GLWD) delivers meals to their homes.  We feed them and their children, and we teach them about healthy eating.  In the past 25 years, we have served over 12 million meals!
