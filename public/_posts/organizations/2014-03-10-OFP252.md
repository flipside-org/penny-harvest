Organization's overview
New York Restoration Project (NYRP) is a non-profit organization dedicated to reclaiming and restoring New York City parks, community gardens and open space. We invest in the communities we serve by providing ongoing maintenance and programs because we believe that every individual has the right to a beautiful neighborhood and the responsibility for contributing to its care.

 
Our city parks and open spaces literally make our urban environment healthier—they clean the air and can help control the damaging effects of rainwater runoff. When well-maintained, they stimulate community and economic development. Parks and open space offer all of us an abundant gift of health—for the body, mind, and spirit. 
 
In just a decade, we’ve created Swindler Cove, a gorgeous new park out of an illegal dump on the Harlem River; saved and revitalized more than 100 community gardens; taught thousands of at-risk children about the environment; built the first boathouse on the Harlem River in 100 years; transformed hundreds of acres of parkland from scary to merry; and in partnership with the City of New York are leading MillionTreesNYC, and planting one million new trees in our town.
