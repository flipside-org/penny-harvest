Organization's overview
BSCAH works very hard to help families that have no  
food to eat. These families also need information to help  
get services that address homelessness, like food  
stamps, health care, nutrition, and education.  We have a  
difficult time finding food, as there is a nationwide food  
shortage.  Food prices have increased, and many times  
we can not buy food especially milk, cereal, rice, meat,  
and juice.  Sometimes we have to turn families away  
because our supermarket style pantry has no food.  This  
is very sad, and at time mothers begin to cry when we  
tell them there is no food.  This is very painful to see  
families, especially children, go without food.  We also  
help families that are sick and suffer because they don't  
have money to buy the right food group.  Many eat food  
that makes them very sick, so we educate them on  
eating right and exercising.  We even have a cooking  
class for children, pregnant mothers and the elderly.
