Organization's overview
The Mohawk Hudson Humane Society (MHHS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has been providing shelter for lost, abused and unwanted animals since 1887. The Society is the oldest and largest animal protection organization in New York's Capital Region, receiving an average of over 6,000 animals per year. 
 
To carry out our work for the animals, MHHS receives no ongoing funding from federal, state or local governments or any other animal welfare organization. We rely on your generous donations to support our vital services for the animals.
