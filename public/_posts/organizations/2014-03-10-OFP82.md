Organization's overview
Hey, don't you wish you had more fun projects to do in class? At DonorsChoose.org, we help teachers make their classes more exciting. Teachers make requests for classroom projects and the materials they need for those projects-- from beakers to books, music to maps, computers to crayons to cleats. Donors then go to our website ( www.donorschoose.org ) and choose which project to bring to life. Since we were founded by a teacher in the Bronx in 2000, DonorsChoose.org has provided over $75 million of educational resources to classrooms across the country. Your pennies can help us provide more fun items to more classrooms - maybe even yours!
