Organization's overview
Have a Heart Children's Cancer Society is a 501(C) 3 charity dedicated to alleviating the financial burden of families with children suffering from cancer.  The funds we raise help families with children under treatment for cancer.  We provide financial support to these families by paying bills associated with medical treatments including transportation & lodging expenses and household expenses (e.g. rent, mortgage, utility bills, car payments, telephone bills, etc...) Children with cancer are usually under treatment for 1 to 4 years---We try to help the families during this difficult time.  We serve families in need in the New York Metropolitan Area.  Photographs and testimonials of some of the children and families we are helping are featured on our website.
