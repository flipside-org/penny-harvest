Organization's overview
The Humane Society of the United States works for the protection of all animals and fights animal cruelty and abuse in all of its forms.  
 
Over the years, we’ve had great success for animals. Some of that success has been a result of the efforts of young people like you. For example, young people played a major role in the passage of a federal law to protect America’s wild horses and burros and in a campaign to protect dolphins from being caught in tuna fishing nets. While we’re proud of our successes, there is still much work to do. We hope you’ll come aboard and help us be a voice for animals.
