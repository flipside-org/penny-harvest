Organization's overview
Rockaway Youth Task Force is an organization founded and 

run by the Rockaway Youth. We involve the youth in the  
area to play a positive role in making our community a  
better place to live and work. One of our biggest goals is to  
get Rockaway youth more involved in the community by  
encouraging community involvement. We volunteer at local  
community centers, hospitals and nursing homes. After  
Hurricane Sandy hit the NY area, Rockaway residents were  
badly effected. For several weeks, many residents had no  
electricity, heat, or access to food and water. The Rockaway  
Youth Task Force quickly gathers its members to setup a  
drop off location. We then went out to buildings and homes  
giving food, water and other essentials to local residents  
that were unable to get these items.
