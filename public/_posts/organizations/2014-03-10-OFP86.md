Organization's overview
Emmaus House is a community of  homeless people that assist other homeless people and the neighboring poor, by providing pantries of clothing and food,  and referrals for services needed. We also go out twice a week to feed and take warm blankets and clothing to the many homeless still out on the streets. We give food in our pantry twice a month to the many who need help stretching their food budget during the month.   
 
We are located on 120th street, and we have a clothing pantry, food pantry, and a traveling kitchen.
