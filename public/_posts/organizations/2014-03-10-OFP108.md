Organization's overview
Greenproofing works with students and people in the neighborhood to improve the environment. We work on planting more trees, plants and flowers in the city. This helps to improve the air we breath and our oceans and rivers. When children and adults work with us they learn more about the environment and they are helping the environment at the same time.
