Organization's overview
TheatreworksUSA is Americaâ€™s largest professional (non- 
profit) theatre for kids and families.  Last year we  
brought 33 shows to 46 states and Canada, reaching   
over two million kids!  In addition, Theatreworks  
distributed 35,000 FREE tickets to schools!  Some of our  
shows may be one of your favorite stories like "Junie B.  
Jones," "Bunnicula," "Charlotte's Web," or "Martha  
Speaks." Theatreworks also presents shows based on  
important historical events and people like Paul Revere,  
Harriet Tubman, and Rosa Parks.  For many kids, seeing  
a Theatreworks show may be the first time they have  
EVER been to the theatre.  We want to make sure that  
ALL kids, no matter where they live or what school they  
go to, can have a live theatre experience that is both  
educational and of course entertaining!
