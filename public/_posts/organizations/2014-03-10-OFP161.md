Organization's overview
Mollie's Fund was started because Mollie passed away from Melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer, when she was only 20 years old.  We knew that we could make a difference and save lives if we taught children, teenagers and adults about the dangers of the sun and how to prevent melanoma.
