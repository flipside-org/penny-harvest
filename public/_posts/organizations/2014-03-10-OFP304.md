Organization's overview
The Hance Family Foundation was created to honor the  
lives of 3 young sisters, Emma, Alyson, and katie Hance,  
who died in a car accident when they were 8, 7, & 5.   
Based on the girls' real life examples, we have children's  
educational programs that help raise self esteem.  Our  
girls self esteem program, Beautiful Me...the EAK Project,  
has already reached over 6,000 girls!  The Hance Family  
foundation also provides back-to-school supplies and  
toys and gifts at Christmas time to underprivileged  
children.  Happy, Healthy, and Safe children are our  
highest priority!
