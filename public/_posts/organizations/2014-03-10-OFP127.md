Organization's overview
New York City is a great place to live and work! But itâ€™s 

expensive, and sometimes families need help finding a  
great place to live, work, and raise children. Hope  
Community makes sure that families, the elderly, and  
former homeless individuals have a home in East  
Harlem. We have over 5,000 low-to middle-income  
residents living in our 80 buildings. We also help small  
businesses in the community grow by offering affordable  
ground floor commercial space in our buildings and by  
organizing fun events like Taste Trolleys that encourage  
people from all over the world to come to East Harlem to  
shop, play, and try new foods!
