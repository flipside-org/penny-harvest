Organization's overview
We provide medical supplies, medical updates and supportto children who are born with a painful and isolating disease called Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)

that causes them to get severe blisters inside and outside their bodies so that they have to spend every day of their lives bandaged like mummies to protect their skin from injuries and to heal the wounds that they already have.
