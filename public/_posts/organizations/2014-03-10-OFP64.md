Organization's overview
Shouldn't every child get the chance to go the school  
their parents think is best for them? We certainly think  
so! Many parents would like to send their children to  
private schools but they cannot afford the tuition.  
Children's Scholarship Fund gives those families  
scholarships that pay for part of the tuition. Here in New  
York City, we help more than 8,000 children go to private  
and parochial schools in all five boroughs. To qualify for  
a scholarship, all the family has to do is prove that they  
have a low income - it doesn't matter what kind of  
grades they are getting. And when one child in the family  
gets chosen for our program, his or her brothers and  
sisters get a scholarship also.
