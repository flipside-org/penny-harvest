Organization's overview
When you think back to teachers you've liked, the class where you had the most fun, the summer when you went on the best trips, and the places you've been where you've learned something that you still can't believe then roll them all into one, you understand what we're trying to do at Addie Mae Collins.  Our organization delivers preschool services through a Head Start program from 2 locations in East Harlem.  The majority of the children who attend the Head Start are from families who are considered poor.  We use every dime we receive to take children places they may never have visited before, to help them learn things that people typically think they can't learn, and to help the families and friends of thosee children we serve who simply can't do everything alone.  We accomplish those goals mostly through the use of fun and inspiring activities designed to uplift, promote a lifelong love of learning, and which allow parents, young children, and siblings an opportunity to improve themselves, and our community.  Addie Mae Collins exists to inspire a love of learning in children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old;and, to help their families.  We try to create a friendly environment and classrooms that inspire a love of learning by creating memorable moments and opportunities you might not have had if we'd never met.
