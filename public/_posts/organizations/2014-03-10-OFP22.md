Organization's overview
Our mission is to sponsor clinical research trials for children with Leukemia and Lymphoma and to improve the quality of life for pediatric cancer patients while they are in the hospital.  We are currently sponsoring an ongoing research project on Targeting Immunotherapy for children who have relasped at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and we sponsor parties such as gift-givings, craft making, cupcake/cookie decorating  and also a music therapist for the Child Life Center at the Hassenself Center for Children with Cancer and Blood Disorders. We also distribute tickets to the children for area events whenever possible.  We have sponsored the First International Symposium on Childhood and Adolescent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and the information gathered at the symposium has benefitted children worldwide.
