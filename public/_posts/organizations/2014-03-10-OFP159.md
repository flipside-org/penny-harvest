Organization's overview
MercyFirst is a child welfare agency that provides services to more than 3500 children and their families each year.   
We believe that every person has the right to feel safe and to develop to their fullest potential.  We offer foster boarding homes to more than 550 children.  We also have 122 young boys and girls living in cottages on our Long Island campus and 7 group homes for young boys and girls who cannot live with their own families.  Many of these young people have been the victims of child abuse or neglect and some have gotten themselves into trouble.  We work with them and their families to try to put the family back together.  We also help hundreds of families who are having trouble keeping their children at home in a safe environment.  The agency is 118 years old!
