Organization's overview
Can you imagine not being able to see? At Freedom Guide Dogs we provide Guide Dogs for the blind and visually impaired. We take the guide dog to their homes so that they can learn how to travel and get around using the guide dog as their eyes. We help people all over New York State and even other states. We want to be able to give more people the freedom to see with a guide dog.
