Organization's overview
Project Hospitality has been helping people for 31 years.  We feed people who are hungry and there are so many of them now because of the bad economy.  We give boys and girls and also men and women a place to live when they do not have anywhere else to go.  We also try to help people who are sick or who have other problems.  We try always to be kind to the people who need our help.  Also, if we did not get help from good people such as those in Penny Harvest we could not help as many people as we do.  We work all over Staten Island which is part of New York City and if you want to see what we do, just let me know.
