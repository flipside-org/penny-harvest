Organization's overview
For the past 27 years, we have provided a home-away-from-home and support for families whose ill or injured children are receiving treatment through Children's Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, NH. We make sure parents, brothers, sisters, and other family members can be close to a hospitalized child for as long as the child is in the hospital. We do not charge families to stay with us, and are the only home available for families who choose to have their child treated at this world-renowned children's hospital.
