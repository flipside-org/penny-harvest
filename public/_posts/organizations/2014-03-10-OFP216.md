Organization's overview
Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) has been providing women, families and youth with vital health services and education since we first opened our doors 90 years ago. We strive to ensure that all individuals have access to important health services, like sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV screenings, pregnancy tests, birth control consultations, and pap smears, regardless of their income level.  
 
PPNYC offers free and reduced services based on economic status and helps many patients fill out paperwork for public programs to cover the cost of their services. We also reach thousands of young people every year through PPNYCâ€™s sexual and reproductive health education programs, which take place in schools, our health centers, and at community based organizations throughout the city.
