Organization's overview
Water.org is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization committed to providing safe drinking water and sanitation to people in developing countries. In many communities we help, children can't attend school because they need to gather water for their family to survive. Some children spend their days walking miles to a nearby river to get water for their family to drink and cook with. The water usually comes from nearby lakes or rivers, livestock and other animals also drink and bathe. The water is often contaminated and causes sickness. Unfortunately, it's the only water available, and in order to survive, the family must drink the contaminated water. WaterPartners was created to help bring clean water and sanitation to the children and families of these communities. It is our goal that everyone in the world should be able to take a safe drink of water.
