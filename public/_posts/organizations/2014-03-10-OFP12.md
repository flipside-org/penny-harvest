Organization's overview
The American Cancer Society helps cancer patients and their families through education, research, and programs.  Education teaches our youth and adults how to avoid certain cancers like lung cancer by avoiding smoking. We have a program called Staten Island Quits which we hope will help to reduce the number of teens on Staten Island that smoke. We help children and families who have someone with cancer through many of our patient and family services programs. We also help to support research to find a cure for all cancers.
