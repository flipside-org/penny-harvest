Organization's overview
Founded in 1979, the inspiration for Feed The Children  
came in Haiti through a chance meeting with a young boy who needed just 20-cents to get his only meal of the day.   
Now, 33 years later, Feed The Children helps provide hope and resources for those without life's essentials in the United States and across the globe. Feed The Children provides 350,000 meals a day worldwide and provides assistance to 10 million people annually in the U.S.
