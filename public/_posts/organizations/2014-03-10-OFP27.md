Organization's overview
A.F.E.W. is an all-volunteer, non-profit organization dedicated to  
the adoption and proper placement of homeless animals, and to  
encourage good animal control by means of spaying and 
neutering. Since we started in 1993, A.F.E.W. has found safe and  
loving homes for over 2100 dogs and cats.
