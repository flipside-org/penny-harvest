Organization's overview
Our chapter of the National MS Society works hard to raise money to help support research to find a cure for MS. Until a cure is found, we work to make the lives of people with MS better through our programs and services. We offer counseling, support groups, recreational activities, home care, meals, equipment, emergency financial assistance, information, resources, legal and employment advice and educational programs for people of all ages living with MS and their family members.
