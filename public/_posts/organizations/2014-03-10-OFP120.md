Organization's overview
Heifer International is a nonprofit organization working to end hunger and poverty and care for the earth through gifts of farm animals and training. Over the last sixty-seven years, Heifer has helped millions of people around the world, including in the US, lift themselves out of poverty. The idea is simple, and it works! Instead of giving hungry people a temporary source of food, Heifer International provides the "living loan" of an animal. A family's health and way of life is greatly improved by all of the things the animal can provide- like milk from a cow or goat, eggs from a chicken or duck, or wool from a sheep or llama. Heifer also teaches people how to care for animals and how to farm in a way that helps, instead of hurts, the natural environment. Each family passes on these gifts to another family in need, creating a chain of hope that lifts entire communities.
