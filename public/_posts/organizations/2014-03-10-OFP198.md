Organization's overview
Panthera works hard to help save the lives, homes and futures of wild cats.  There are 37 species, or types, of wild cats, including tigers, lions, jaguars and snow leopards. Wild cats are beautiful animals, and also important, because they help keep things in balance in the wild.  
 
Wild animals all over the world are facing many threats, as human populations grow and use more and more of the land that the animals once called home.  Wild cats are especially at risk, because they are often seen as a danger to humans and livestock.  Many of them, like tigers, are classified as 'endangered,' which means that it is possible that they could die out completely.  Can you imagine a world without tigers?   
 
At Panthera, we want to make sure that all of the wild cats have a safe place to live in the wild.  We do that by working to save their homes from being destroyed to build things like roads or factories.  We help protect big cats from poachers, or people who kill them illegally.  Our scientists also study the big cats in the wild to see what new problems they may be facing, like a lack of food, and to find ways to help.
