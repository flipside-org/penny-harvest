Organization's overview
For Our Friends is a dog rescue group. We rescue dogs from the streets and from the city shelters where they are in danger because of overcrowding. We provide every dog with the medical attention they need. This is one of our biggest expenses. We find every dog the loving "forever home" that is best for them. For instance, we rescue many older dogs and place them in homes of retired, mature people. We spend a lot of time interviewing new owners so that we can place every dog in the best home. We also spend a lot of time training and getting the dogs ready for their new homes. We help people that can no longer keep their dogs find new homes for them by putting them on our website. We are an all volunteer group and every penny donated goes directly to rescue more pets, nobody receives a salary. Recently we have rescued several dogs that have lost thier home because of Hurricane Sandy.
