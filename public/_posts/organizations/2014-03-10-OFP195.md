Organization's overview
Our Lady of Sorrows Food Pantry helps needy people by giving them groceries when they do not have enough money to buy the groceries they need.  Together with Connecting To Advantages we also help them to become more independent by helping them with Food Stamps, paying bills, and any other problems they may have.    We are open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  We serve the food bags between 1:30 and 3:00 p.m.
