Organization's overview
Imagine you had a disease that destroyed your skin, heart, brain, kidneys or lungs.  Over 1.5 million Americans have this chronic illness called Lupus and for over 40 years, the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation has been helping those in the NYC area affected by this devastating disease.  The Foundation does this by educating and informing the public about the disease, supporting scientists who are trying to find a cure for lupus, and offering services to patients and their families.  We have offices in Manhattan, East Harlem, the Bronx and Brooklyn and work with the community to increase awareness of lupus so that we can increase early diagnosis.
