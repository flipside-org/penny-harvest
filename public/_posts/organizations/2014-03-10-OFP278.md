Organization's overview
We are a Pediatric Clinic in St. John's Episcopal Hospital. 
Our goal is to offer quality medical care to babies, infants, children and adolescents.  We also try to educate our patients and their families.  We run a Reach Out and Read Program through which we hope to advance literacy in the community and encourage parents to read to their children.  Through this program we provide the children in our clinic with brand new books to read at home with their families. (Spanish and English)
