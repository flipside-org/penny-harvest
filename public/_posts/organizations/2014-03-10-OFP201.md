Organization's overview
The Food Pantry at Park Avenue Synagogue is a community service program entirely run by high school Students. Every week, throughout the year, students from high schools, in New York, come together to make packages for less fortunate people. The financial aspects are organized and the packages are entirely made by students. Every Friday our clients come to the Synagogue to receive, depending on the size of their families, a number of large and small packages. The packages include vegetables, pasta, beans, soup and more. We hand out an average of about 400 packages each week, and on Thanksgiving, more than 700 packages are handed out! The Food Pantry has been a continuous community service for 25 years. Throughout the years students have formed lifetime friendships with the clients. Each day we (the students) strive to improve the lives of others in whatever way we can!
