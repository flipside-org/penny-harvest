Organization's overview
The New York Aquarium celebrates the wonders of the ocean and educates visitors about marine animals and conservation.  Its buildings were recently devastated by the impact of Hurricane Sandy. We are committed to rebuilding and transforming the Aquarium, to come back better than ever.  This process will take several years to complete.
