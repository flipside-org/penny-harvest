Organization's overview
Imagine not being able to read your teacher’s notes on 

the chalkboard, or having to squint  
your eyes to read a math equation on the overheard  
projector.  For many children your  
age this is common.   Unfortunately, there are tons of  
kids in New York City (and around  
the country) whose parents cannot afford a trip to the  
eye doctor or a pair of glasses to fix  
this. 
 
The good news is that ChildSight® goes into schools to  
test the vision of students in need,  
and if they have vision problems, provides them with  
free eyeglasses.  This means these  
same students who were squinting and couldn’t read the  
chalkboard will now be able to  
see clearly and focus on their school work. 
 
ChildSight® is the domestic program of the international  
non-profit, Helen Keller  
International (HKI).  HKI works around the world to  
prevent blindness and reduce  
malnutrition.  In the US, HKI’s ChildSight® program  
screens over 100,000 students and  
provides approximately 20,000 pairs of eyeglasses to  
students each year.
