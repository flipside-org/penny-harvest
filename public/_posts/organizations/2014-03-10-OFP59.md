Organization's overview
The Child Abuse Prevention Program (CAPP), a independent non-profit agency founded in 1986, is the only agency of its kind. Over the past 27 years, CAPP has reached over 440,000 New York City school children and made them aware of their right to be safe. Our mission is to insure that all of our children enjoy this basic right. CAPP provides vital child safety information to children, families, community groups and law enforcement agencies. The cornerstone of CAPPâ€™s work is an award-winning Child Safety Workshop that uses life-sized puppets to teach school children to recognize, resist and report instances of abuse and neglect.
