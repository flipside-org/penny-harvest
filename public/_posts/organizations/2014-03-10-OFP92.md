Organization's overview
FeelGoodCU is the Columbia University chapter of FeelGood, which has taken root on 24 university campuses.  FeelGood is a youth movement committed to ending world hunger in our lifetime. On college campuses across the U.S., FeelGood students run non-profit delis specializing in grilled cheese sandwiches. 100% of deli proceeds are invested in organizations sustainably eradicating global hunger.  Our chapter in particular gives all deli proceeds to The Hunger Project. FeelGood delis are also a place for creative interaction and education—an inviting environment for customers to learn about hunger’s causes, consequences and solutions. By learning to run a successful social enterprise, we experience firsthand our capacity as changemakers: People with the ability to respond creatively, compassionately and strategically to the world's most pressing needs.
