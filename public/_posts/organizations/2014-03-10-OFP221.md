Organization's overview
It's not fair that some children can't play sports simply  
because they don't have use of their legs or other parts  
of their body, or because they have difficulty  
understanding what to do. Project HAPPY is a sports  
program for young people who have disabilities. HAPPY  
Saturdays are the only time that they have the  
opportunity to enjoy the kinds of sports activities that the  
rest of us take for granted. They enjoy wheelchair  
basketball, bowling, dance, soccer, and swimming. With  
your pennies, you can help us make sure that these  
programs continue!
