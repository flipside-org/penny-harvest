      <p>The Organization Finder is a tool that aids the children that participate in the <a href="http://pennyharvest.org" title="Penny Harvest by Common Cents">Penny Harvest project</a> to find the right destination for their grants. Children between the ages of four and 14 have been converting their natural compassion for others into action by collecting pennies and turning those pennies into grants for community organizations.</p>

      <p>The Penny Harvest shows young people they have the ability to make the world a better place by introducing them to the power of philanthropy and service during their formative years. As children help others, they develop their generosity and moral character, and they learn through practice the skills and responsibilities of democratic participation.</p>
